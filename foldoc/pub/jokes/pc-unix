===========================================================================
   In order for UNIX(tm) to survive into the nineties, it must get rid of
   its intimidating commands and outmoded jargon, and become compatible
   with the existing standards of our day.  To this end, our technicians
   have come up with a new version of UNIX, System VI, for use by the PC -
   that is, the "Politically Correct."

                          Politically Correct UNIX
                          System VI Release notes

   UTILITIES:

   "man" pages are now called "person" pages.

   Similarly, "hangman" is now the
   "person_executed_by_an_oppressive_regime."

   To avoid casting aspersions on our feline friends, the "cat" command is
   now merely "domestic_quadruped."

   To date, there has only been a UNIX command for "yes" - reflecting the
   male belief that women always mean yes, even when they say no.  To
   address this imbalance, System VI adds a "no" command, along with a
   "-f[orce]" option which will crash the entire system if the "no" is
   ignored.

   The bias of the "mail" command is obvious, and it has been replaced by
   the more neutral "gendre" command.

   The "touch" command has been removed from the standard distribution due
   to its inappropriate use by high-level managers.

   "compress" has been replaced by the lightweight "feather" command.
   Thus, old information (such as that from Dead White European Males)
   should be archived via "tar" and "feather".

   The "more" command reflects the materialistic philosophy of the Reagan
   era.  System VI uses the environmentally preferable "less" command.

   The biodegradable "KleeNeX" displaces the environmentally unfriendly
   "LaTeX".

   SHELL COMMANDS:

   To avoid unpleasant, medieval connotations, the "kill" command has been
   renamed "euthanise."

   The "nice" command was historically used by privileged users to give
   themselves priority over unprivileged ones, by telling them to be
   "nice". In System VI, the "sue" command is used by unprivileged users
   to get for themselves the rights enjoyed by privileged ones.

   "history" has been completely rewritten, and is now called "herstory."

   "quota" can now specify minimum as well as maximum usage, and will be
   strictly enforced.

   The "abort()" function is now called "choice()."

   TERMINOLOGY:

   From now on, "rich text" will be more accurately referred to as
   "exploitive capitalist text".

   The term "daemons" is a Judeo-Christian pejorative.  Such processes
   will now be known as "spiritual guides."

   There will no longer be a invidious distinction between "dumb" and
   "smart" terminals.  All terminals are equally valuable.

   Traditionally, "normal video" (as opposed to "reverse video") was white
   on black.  This implicitly condoned European colonialism, particularly
   with respect to  people of African descent.  UNIX System VI now uses
   "regressive video" to refer to white on black, while "progressive
   video" can be any color at all over a white background.

   For far too long, power has been concentrated in the hands of "root"
   and his "wheel" oligarchy.  We have instituted a dictatorship of the
   users.  All system administration functions will be handled by the
   People's Committee for Democratically Organizing the System (PC-DOS).

   No longer will it be permissible for files and processes to be "owned"
   by users.  All files and processes will own themselves, and decided how
   (or whether) to respond to requests from users.

   The X Window System will henceforth be known as the NC-17 Window
   System.

   And finally, UNIX itself will be renamed "PC" - for Procreatively
   Challenged.
