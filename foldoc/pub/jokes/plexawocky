	Twas midnight, and the UNIX set
	Did gyre and gimble in dismay;
	All mimsy was the Ethernet,
	And robots were at play.
	
	Beware of System V, my son!
	The bugs that bite, the jobs that thrash!
	Beware the broken pipe, and shun
	The frumious system crash.
	
	He took his Logic Probe in hand,
	Long time the INIT bug he sought;
	Till rested he by the ICP,
	And stood awhile in thought.
	
	And as in uffish thought he stood
	The Plexus lights like tiny flames
	Told him it was just no good:
	The machine had crashed again!
	
	One two, one two, and through and through
	The manuals he scanned;
	At last he knew that it was true,
	That nothing worked as planned.
	
	Twas midnight, and the UNIX set
	Did gyre and gimble in dismay;
	All mimsy was the Ethernet,
	And robots were at play.
