-------------------------------------------------
A chap from Brussel wanted to go to London for a holiday. When he heard
that the drive on the wrong side of the road, he decided to have some
training and started driving on the left side of the road two month
before going. After a month he decided not to go, because it is far to
dangerous to drive on the left side of the road.
