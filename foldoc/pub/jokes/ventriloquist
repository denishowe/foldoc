A famous ventriloquist is having a show in Norway.  The doll sitting
on his lap is telling funny jokes about Swedes all the time.  The
audience really enjoy themselves, as they scream with laughter.  I
mean, this guy is so funny!

But one guy is not laughing.  He looks in fact quite angry, and more
and more so for each Swede-joke he hears.

As the show approaches the end, he suddenly stands up, and shouts:

"HEY, YOU! I am a Swede, and I am sick and tired of all these
Swede-jokes!  You have been telling jokes about us Swedes all
afternoon, and I am more than fed up!  It is very rude of you to pick
on us Swedes like that!  I think you should stop the show immediately!
The Swedish people are not as stupid as you tell in your jokes!"

"Hey, calm down!", says the ventriloquist.  "Come on, it is only
jokes!  Nobody takes them serio..."

"I AM NOT TALKING TO YOU!  I AM TALKING TO THE LITTLE GUY IN YOUR
LAP!"
