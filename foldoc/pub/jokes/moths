I claim the joke below to be the funniest joke ever sent to this news group.

Well, there was this woman in bed with another man (ie. not her husband !)
and they were ... (use your imagination). Suddenly the husbands car pulls up
outside the house as he's left work early today. He walks up the stairs
and into the bedroom and to his astonishment he sees a man stalking around the
room and occasionally clapping his hands together really hard.
  "What the hell are you doing?" balled the husband.
  "Well,er..., We've had complaints about MOTHS around this area and so I've 
come around to rid you of these pests" the man said, not too convincingly, and
clapped his hands together as if he was killing one of the pests.
  The husband looked a little bemused and said "Why haven't you got any
clothes on then?".
  The man stopped stalking around and looked down at his naked body.
"BASTARDS",he said.

Steve.
