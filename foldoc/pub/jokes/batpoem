            A Christmas Batpoem for Denis....
            =================================

         Take me back to Gotham City
                 Batman
         Take me where the girls are pretty
                 Batman


         All those damsels in distress
         Half-undressed or even less
         The BatPill makes 'em all say Yes
                 Batman


         Help us out in Vietnam
                 Batman
         Help us drop that BatNapalm
                 Batman

         Help us bomb those jungle towns
         Spreading pain and death around
         Coke 'n Candy wins 'em round
                 Batman

         Help us smash the Vietcong
                 Batman
         Help us show them that they're wrong
                 Batman

         Help us spread Democracy
         Get them high on L.S.D.
         Make them just like you and me
                Batman


         Show me what I have to do
                Batman
         'Cause I want to be like you
                Batman

         Flash your Batsign over Lime street
         Batmobiles down every crime street
         Happy Batday that's when I'll meet
                Batman
