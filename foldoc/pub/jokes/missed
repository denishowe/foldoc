Two nuns and the Mother Superior were out golfing one day.  At the first 
hole, the Mother Superior steps up and strokes a perfect shot straight 
down the fairway.  The first nun follows and outdistances her.  The 
second nun steps up, and hits the ball into the rough.  "Aw shit, I 
missed!" she says.  "Don't speak that way, God will punish you." the 
Mother Superior tells her.

At the second hole, again the Mother Superior and the first nun hit 
perfect drives, while the second nun hits into the water hazard.  "Aw 
shit, I missed!" she says again.  Again, the Mother Superior tells her 
"If you speak that way, God will punish you."

At the third hole, the same thing happens again.  "Aw shit, I missed!" 
the nun screams.  Suddenly, a bolt of lightning steaks from the sky, and 
kills the Mother Superior.  A voice from Heaven drifts down, saying "Aw 
shit, I missed!"
