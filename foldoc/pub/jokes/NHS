Princess Diana visited a local hospital recently on a fact finding tour
and made it known that she wanted to see ALL aspects of hospital life.
She was given the <complete> tour by the hospital administrators; she
watched an operation, she used the X-ray, she swilled out bed pans, did
some embalming, extracted teeth/babies (not at the same time) and a lot
more besides (the type of things the future queen of England normally
does). At the end of a long and tiring day she was being escorted out of
the hospital and passed a locked door marked "PRIVATE".

"What does one find in there ?" asked the Regal one.

"We would rather you didn't go in there" replied the chief surgeon.

"I made it clear that I wanted to see everything" stormed Di.

"All right, all right, you can go in" the poor man replied and unlocked
the door.

"This is where we have all the vasectomy patients" the surgeon told the
princess as they entered a long room lined with curtained cubicles, all
closed.

"Let me see in this cubicle" ordered Di. The curtains were drawn back to
reveal a nurse wanking the male patient.

"What is she doing ?" asked the sheltered princess.

"She is obtaining some sperm so we can make a sperm count to check if
the vasectomy has been successful" came the reply. Di walked to the next
booth and flung back the curtains revealing the same scene; a young
nurse tossing off the patient. She walked to the next and drew the
curtains and saw a beautiful young nurse sucking the man off.

"What's this ?!" Di exclaimed.

"BUPA"
