Project Reporting
.PP
In the beginning was the DEMO Project.  And the Project was
without form.  And darkness was upon the staff members thereof.  So
they spake unto their Group Leader, saying, "It is a crock of shit,
and it stinks."
.PP
And the Group Leader spake unto his Division Manager, saying,
"It is a crock of excrement and none may abide the odour thereof."  Now,
the Division Manager spake unto his Laboratory Manager, saying, "It is a
container of excrement, and is very strong, such that none may abide
before it."  And it came to pass that the Laboratory Manager spake unto
the Assistant Technical Director, saying, "It is a vessel of fertilizer
and none may abide by its strength."
.PP
And the assistant Technical Director spake thus unto the
Technical Director, saying, "It containeth that which aids growth and
it is very strong."  And, Lo, the Technical Director spake then unto
the Chairman, saying, "The powerful new Project will help promote the
growth of the Laboratories."
.PP
And the Chairman looked down upon the Project, and He saw that
it was Good!
