		A SLIGHT CASE OF MISUNDERSTANDING

THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT'S  POLICY OF SOCIALIZED MEDICINE HAS RECENTLY BEEN
BROADENED TO INCLUDE A SERVICE  CALLED  "PROXY FATHERS."  UNDER THE GOV'T
PLAN, ANY MARRIED WOMAN WHO IS UNABLE  TO  BECOME PREGNANT DURING THE 1ST
YEARS OF MARRIAGE MAY REQUEST THE SERVICE OF  A  "PROXY FATHER" - A GOV'T
EMPLOYEE WHO  ATTEMPTS  TO  SOLVE  THE  WOMANS  PROBLEM  BY  GETTING  HER
PREGNANT

THE SMITHS, A YOUNG MARRIED COUPLE, HAVE  NO  CHILDREN AND THE GOVERNMENT
MAN IS DUE TO ARRIVE. MR. SMITH, ON LEAVING SAYS, "I'M OFF, THE GOV'T MAN
SHOULD BE HERE SOON." INSTEAD, HOWEVER A DOOR-TO-DOOR PHOTOGRAPH SALESMAN
CAME TO THE SMITH'S TRYING  TO SELL BABY PICTURES.  THE CONVERSATION WENT
AS FOLLOWS:

MS. SMITH: "GOOD MORNING."
SALESMAN:  "GOOD MORNING.  YOU DON'T KNOW ME BUT I'VE COME TO--"
MS. SMITH: "OH, YOU DON'T HAVE TO EXPLAIN.  MY HUSBAND TOLD  ME  YOU WERE
	   COMMING."
SALESMAN:  "OH?  WELL GOOD. I'VE MADE A SPECIALTY  OF  BABIES, ESPECIALLY
	   TWINS."
MS. SMITH: "THAT'S WHAT MY HUSBAND SAID.  PLEASE SIT DOWN."
SALESMAN:  "THEN YOUR HUSBAND PROBABLY TOLD YOU THAT..."
MS. SMITH: "OH, YES WE BOTH AGREE THIS IS THE BEST THING TO DO."
SALESMAN:  "WELL, IN THAT CASE,  PERHAPS WE SHOULD GET RIGHT ON WITH IT."
MS. SMITH: (BLUSHING) "WELL, JUST WHERE DO WE START?"
SALESMAN:  "JUST LEAVE EVERYTHING TO ME.  I USUALLY TRY 2 IN THE BATHTUB,
            1 ON THE COUCH AND PERHAPS A FEW IN BED. SOMETIMES THE LIVING
            ROOM FLOOR WORKS WELL"
MS. SMITH: "BATHTUB,  LIVING ROOM FLOOR?   NO WONDER IT HASN'T WORKED FOR
            HARRY AND ME."
SALESMAN:  "WELL LADY, NONE OF US CAN GUARANTEE A GOOD ONE EVERYTIME, BUT
            IF WE TRY 6 OR 7 TIMES ONE OF THEM  IS  BOUND TO BE A HONEY."
MS. SMITH: "PARDON ME, BUT ISN'T THIS A LITTLE INFORMAL?"
SALESMAN:  "NO, INDEED,  IN MY LINE A MAN  CAN'T DO HIS WORK IN A HURRY."
MS. SMITH: "WELL, HAVE YOU HAD MUCH SUCCESS AT THIS?"
SALESMAN:  (OPENING HIS BRIEFCASE  AND SHOWING BABY PICTURES)  "JUST LOOK
            AT THESE BABIES. THEY'RE ALL  JOBS  I'VE HANDLED IN THE PAST.
            THIS ONE TOOK FOUR HOURS."
MS. SMITH: "YES, THAT IS A LOVELY CHILD."
SALESMAN:  "BUT IF YOU WANT TO HEAR ABOUT A REALLY TOUGH ASSIGNMENT, LOOK
            AT THIS PICTURE BELIEVE IT OR NOT IT WAS DONE ON TOP OF A BUS
            IN DOWNTOWN LONDON."
MS. SMITH: "OH, MY GODD!!!"
SALESMAN:  "AND HERE ARE PICTURES  OF  THE PRETTIEST TWINS IN TOWN.  THEY
            TURNED OUT VERY WELL WHEN YOU CONSIDER  THAT THEIR MOTHER WAS
            HARD TO WORK WITH."
MS. SMITH: "OH, WAS SHE?"
SALESMAN:  "YES, I'M AFRAID SO.  I FINALLY HAD  TO  TAKE HER DOWN TO HYDE
            PARK TO GET THE JOB DONE RIGHT.  I'VE NEVER WORKED UNDER SUCH
            DIFFICULT CONDITIONS.  PEOPLE  WERE  CROWDING AROUND FOUR AND
            FIVE DEEP PUSHING TO GET A GOOD LOOK."
MS. SMITH: "FOUR OR FIVE DEEP?"
SALESMAN:  "YES, AND FOR MORE THAN THREE HOURS, TOO.  BUT I FINALLY GOT A
            COUPLE OF BUDDIES OF MINE TO KEEP THEM BACK.  I COULD'VE SHOT
            AGAIN BEFORE BEFORE DARK; BUT BY THAT TIME THE SQUIRRELS WERE
            BEGINNING TO NIBBLE ON MY EQUIPMENT AND I HAD TO GIVE UP."
MS. SMITH: "YOU MEAN THEY ACTUALLY CHEWED  ON  YOUR,  AH--EQUIPTMENT...?"
SALESMAN:  "YES,  BUT  IT'S ALL  IN  A  DAYS  WORK,  I CONSIDER MY WORK A
            PLEASURE.  I'VE SPENT 3 LONG YEARS PERFECTING  MY  TECHNIQUE.
            NOW, TAKE THIS BABY.   I SHOT THIS ONE IN THE FRONT WINDOW OF
            A BIG DEPARTMENT STORE."
MS. SMITH: "I JUST CAN'T BELIEVE IT."
SALESMAN:  "WELL,  MADAM IF YOU'RE READY I'LL SET UP MY TRIPOD SO THAT WE
            WE CAN GET TO WORK NOW."
MS. SMITH: "TRIPOD????"
SALESMAN:  "OH YES, I HAVE TO USE A TRIPOD TO REST MY EQUIPTMENT ON. IT'S
            MUCH TOO HEAVY FOR ME TO HOLD IN MY HAND  WHILE I'M TRYING TO
            USE IT."
SALESMAN:  "MS. SMITH...MS. SMITH...MS. SMITH.  GOODNESS, SHE FAINTED !!"
