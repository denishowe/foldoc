A programmer goes to the doctor and says, "Doc, our shop is switching from VAX
over to IBM.  Is there anything that you can do to help me with the transition?

Doctor:  "Sure, no problem.  All we have to do is remove 10% of your brain and
you'll be all set."

So they do the operation.  The programmer wakes up in the recovery room.

Doctor: "Sir, I'm afraid there's been a terrible mistake.  We accidentally
removed 90% of your brain instead of 10%".

Programmer: "Grep. Awk."
