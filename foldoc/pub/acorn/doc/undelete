I am not aware of any program which does such a thing but maybe I can suggest
a way to do it (however it could become messy and it usually involves a lot
of work...).  It should work with all kind of drives (adfs, scsi, idefs, etc.).

- Go somewhere in command mode (shift-F12 or F12) and make your drive the
  current one (eg. *scsi, *dir :4).
- Type *map, now you receive a list of all the free blocks of your (hard)disc
  and one or more of these blocks will actually contain (parts of) your file...
- In your map list you always see couples of two hex numbers.  The first number
  shows you the disc address of that free block and second one is the length
  of that free block.  We will 'claim' these free blocks by creating new files
  by *beginning with the largest free block* and than progressively take the
  smaller ones !
  So, if  your map reads (the format could be slightly different) :

  (00a400, 400), (00c400, 800), (01e000, 800)

  then you type :

  *create <first filename> 800
  *create <second filename> 800
  *create <third filename> 400
  ... and so on ...
- After claiming all the free blocks, your disk should full (try *free).
  You can now go into the desktop, load your own most favorite text editor and
  have a look at all those new files.  One or more of them should contain
  (parts of) your file...

As I said, it's quite messy so... anyone fancy to write a program which can
deal better with this problem ?
