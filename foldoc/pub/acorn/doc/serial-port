Having recently had my own (now solved) serial comms problems, I have
loads of info to hand... though I'd hesitate to call myself a comms
expert!

Firstly, I think you'll find that the A420 doesn't have a RS423 port,
but a (specially bug-ridden Acorn flavour of) RS232... RS423 only has 5
pins, so you couldn't really be connecting pins 1, 4, 6 and 8 together...
(RS423 uses a circular DIN plug, and was the serial connector for the
BBC micro.)

Now I know that there's information floating around that suggests
connecting pins 1, 4 and 6 of Acorn serial plugs, and other information
that suggests linking pins 1, 4 and 8, but I've never seen both
together... the latter, by the way, seems to be the Acorn-recommended
method. Maybe this is why you're having problems?

You haven't made it clear which type of RS232 the other devicve is
using; it may be 9-pin or 25-pin. Here are Acorn's recommended wiring
diagrams for both types (dated 5th July 1994):

7. RTS  -- | ------------------------------------------  RTS  4.
           |
8. CTS  ---+

9. RI   -----------------------------------------------  DCD  8.

Note: if you're trying to use am Apple LaserWriter with a 25-pin RS232,
the wiring is rather more complicated - I won't bother turning it into
ASCII unless someone actually needs it!

It is also worth noting that A5000s and Risc PCs (and presumably later
computers) can be configured in software to utilise PC-wired cables just
like any IBM clone would... this does away with all this messy
non-standard wiring, but is unfortunately not much use if you have an
older computer... :-(

Hope that helps!

OS_SerialOp 5 & 6 (and OS_byte 7 & 8) now take three extra baud rate codes
in RISC OS 3.5:

16 - 38400
17 - 57600
18 - 115200

The "modules" file is a binary archive which may be decompressed using 
either ArcFS 2 or SparkFS. Remember to set your ftp client to binary mode 
before downloading this file.

These two modules are written to run under RISC OS 3.10, and improve 
integrity of serial communications (particularly receiving) at speeds of 9600 
baud and above. They were included in the ROM distribution for RISC OS 3.11, 
and as such are not needed on systems equipped with this version of the OS.

They should be *RMLoaded on system bootup.
