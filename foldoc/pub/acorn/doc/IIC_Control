Unfortunately, the RISC OS 2 PRMs got the read/write sense of IIC_Control
reversed. This error has more potentially severe side effects than any other
we're aware of. We have done our best to publicise this error, and have also
corrected it in the RISC OS 3 PRMs. However, for those of you who don't have
a copy, here is the correct description of this SWI:

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
IIC_Control (SWI &240)
======================

Control IIC devices

On entry
--------
R0 = device address (bit 0 = 0 to write, bit 0 = 1 to read)
R1 = pointer to block
R2 = length of block in bytes

On exit
-------
R0 - R2 preserved

Interrupts
----------
Interrupts are disabled
Fast interrupts are enabled

Processor Mode
--------------
Processor is in SVC mode

Re-entrancy
-----------
SWI is not re-entrant

Use
---
This call allows reading and writing to IIC devices. IIC is an internal
serial protocol. It is used in RISC OS machines for writing to the clock
chip and IIC compatible devices on expansion cards.

The possible error is `No acknowledge from IIC device' (&20300).

Related SWIs

None

Related vectors

I hope this helps anyone trying to use this SWI.
