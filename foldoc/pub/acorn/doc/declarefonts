Whilst looking for something else I came across the information in the
RO3 PRMs about printing, so I thought I would type in the bit about
declaring fonts which is specific to RO3.

After calling PDriver_SelectJob you should declare the fonts your document
uses by calling PDriver_DeclareFont for each distinct font your document
uses.  You should check bit 29 of PDriver_Info features word first which
will be set if the printer driver supports PDriver_DeclareFont.

PDriver_DeclarFont (SWI &80155)
In:
R0 = font handle (or zero to use R1)
R1 = pointer to name of font (or zero to use R0)
R2 = flags word
     bit 0 set = don't download font even if not present within device
     bit 1 set = when font is used kerning is applied
 all other bits zero.
Out:
R0-R2 preserved.

Any font name passed must be identical to the name passed to Font_FindFont,
including any encoding and matrix information.

After all fonts have been declared make one last call with R0 = R1 = 0.
This should also be done even if no fonts are used.

I hope the above helps.  I have used your Family program and like it,
although the screen redraw seems a bit slow on an ARM2.  Apart from that
it's great.

Andrew.
