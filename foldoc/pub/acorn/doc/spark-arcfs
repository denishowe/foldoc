   ArcFS or SparkFS - which one to use ?

   I'm confused (aren't I always). Here we are with two archiving programs,
   which are both good, but incompatible. Spark is always used for ftp sites,
   but ArcFS is used on all the magazine cover discs.
Bit of history called for here I think.

Originally there was spark, and it was good. It archived stuff in archives
according to its own special fileformat. These I shall call Sparkives, and
the mighty Pilling gave unto them the filetype DDC.

And some people said: 'Yay, it is good, but what happens if I want to give
archives to my mates?'. So the Pilling gave unto them SparkPlug, which
decompressed only.

Then came Spark 2, and it was better - it introduced a modified version of
the Sparkive that could hold more. Also, it could read and write some
'foreign' archive types. So Spark 2 could read both Spark 1 and Spark 2
files, wheras Spark 1 could read only a subset of the Spark 2 files.

And then there was SparkPlug 2. And thou canst guess what this did.

And someone saw it and said 'Yes, it is good, but it could be better
- wouldn't it be nice if it allowed you to run applications from
Archives.' So he wrote ArcFS 1.

All it did was allow you to access spark archives as a filing system.
So you could actually run applications from within archives. But
this was written in C, and was slow, and expensive on memory, as
the entirety of open files were held in RAM as they were accessed.

Then came ArcFS 2. This was 'better', as it also archived stuff, but
in a different format, but still maintained the ability to read
Spark files. It was also written in ARM Code, and so was much faster.

And Pilling Saw that this was good, and saw also that spark could
also be written in this way and could handle all manner of new
archive types. So he wrote SparkFS.

And SparkFS was dead good. It coped with every archive type known
to man (almost), and was extensible, so as people can write their
own types. And it runs as archives. And it offers the best compression
ratios currently around on the Arc. And it supports gzip. And I
bought a copy ( :-) ). And it costs #23.00, (with 6 pounds off if you
have Spark, and another 6 if you have ArcFS) from David Pilling.

The only drawback is that SparkFS cannot write and read ArcFS archives
(though I believe it can read them)

Now, Spark 2 has been updated in parallel with SparkFS, so it can cope
with some of the same formats (Things like McStuffit may not be
implemented. It still costs 5.99, and comes free with SparkFS.

SparkPlug is freeware, and copes (decompressing) with the same as Spark.
Can be found on newcastle.

ArcFS 2 read only is freeware (and is the one found on mag discs, cos it
is the smallest executable.)

ArcFS 2 read/write is available from Software 42, for I know not how much.

Overall, if you are just looking for an Archiver, it is a toss up between
the two. if you are looking for some thing to cope with Foreign Archives,
then you need something from the Spark Family. SparkFS is worth the
dosh if you can afford it.

                                                If I have say Spark reader
   module loaded, and then (for instance) mount a magazine cover disc, I get
   sometimes fatal crashes. So if I want one for home use, which one should
   I get.

IMHO, Spark or SparkFS. Buy Spark, and upgrade if you need it. It costs
the same in the long run.

   I know ArcFS quotes decompression speeds, is it quicker than SparkFS ? They 
   both support Image Filing systems, which would be nice. Which one is more
   memory efficient - or are they both bad/good ?

They are both about the same memorywise, but SparkFS can use the Sprite
Pool rather than RMA, and so is much more memory freindly as comes
to defragmentation.

   Comments anyone ?

None that I can think of :-)

ArcFS 2.20 is available from Vertical Twist. Software 42 hasn't "closed down"
or "gone to the wall" as suggested in some magazines, it has turned into a
software development company, and Vertical Twist / GamesWare are handling
the sales and marketing of most of their existing products. All three of the
partners in Software 42 Developments have Email access, as does Mark Smith,
author of ArcFS. David Pilling (of Spark/FS fame) also has Email access.

In a mail from David Pilling recently he said the latest version
of SparkFS is 1.25.
