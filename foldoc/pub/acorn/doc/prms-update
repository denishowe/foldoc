So far as I'm aware we have maintained backwards compatibility.

Again, so far as I'm aware we have maintained backwards compatibility. Some
calls have been extended, and there may be new ones, but I haven't got a
RISC OS 2 machine or PRM at hand to double check.

Vector Services Ltd

Send a cheque for #63 (#59 + #4 p&p) made payable to 'Acorn Direct', and the
front cover of the *Index* volume of your RISC OS 2 PRM. No phone number
that I know of.

Once you've got the new PRM, it should answer your above queries in full...

Yes.

Send 64 pounds (inc p&p) to Acorn Direct along with your previous PRM Index
cover.

Address:             13 Denington Road
                     WELLINGBOROUGH

This is, of course, for UK customers - I haven't a clue what overseas folks
do!
