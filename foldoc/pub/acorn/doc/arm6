I recently received the 1992/93 shortform catalog from GEC-Plessey
Semiconductors. This has the following ARM chips:

Type                  Max clock freq.       MIPS      Package
P60ARM(4)                  20 MHz             6         GP100
P600ARM(4)                 20 MHz            14         GP160
P610ARM(4)                 20 MHz            14(2)     TQFP144
PFPA10ARM(3)               20 MHz            N/A        HP64

(1) Manufactured under Licence from Advanced RISC Machines Ltd.
(2) Approximate speed, assuming use of DRAM for external memory.
(3) Also requires FPA support code, as some instructions are
    implemented in software.
(4) Software Development Toolkit available.

The ARM60 is just an ARM6 macrocell + whatever is needed to get it going.
The ARM600 is an ARM6 with 4 KB 64-way set-associativ cache, MMU based
on MEMC2, write buffer (8 words, I think) and coprosessor interface.
The ARM610 is essantially an ARM600 without coprosessor interface.
There are a few more differences, and if anyone is interested, I could
post that too.

VLSI Technology manufactures the ARM61 in addition. This is just an
ARM2 built around the ARM6 macrocell.

I have the data books for the ARM6, ARM60 and ARM610 from GEC-Plessey,
and the full addresses for the Consumer Service Centres.

Please email me if you want the full adresses for the above. I also
have adresses to the world wide distributors.
