                                            Introduction

GEDCOM was developed by the Family History Department of the Church of Jesus Christ of
Latter-day Saints to provide a flexible uniform format for exchanging computerized genealogical
data.  GEDCOM is an acronym for GEnealogical Data Communication.  GEDCOM is provided to
foster the sharing of genealogical information and the development of a wide range of inter-operable
software products to assist genealogists, historians, and other researchers.

Purpose and Content of This Document

This technical document is written for computer programmers, system developers, and technically
sophisticated users. 

The chapters in this document contain the following GEDCOM specifications: 
       *  Data Representation Grammar              *  Values
       *  Lineage-linked GEDCOM Grammar            *  Character Sets
       *  GEDCOM Transmission File                       

This document describes GEDCOM at two different levels.  The lower level defines a general-
purpose data representation language for representing any kind of structured information in a
sequential media.  The higher level defines specific content for data to be exchanged between
compatible systems.

The lower level is known as the GEDCOM data format and deals with the syntax and
identification of structured information in general, but does not deal with the semantic content of
any particular kind of data.  The lower level GEDCOM format and the basic GEDCOM concepts
are presented in chapter 1.  This chapter will also be useful to those using GEDCOM for other
kinds of data, not just genealogical data.

The higher level is known as a GEDCOM form.  A GEDCOM form is defined for each kind of data
that uses the GEDCOM data format.  The only GEDCOM form presented in this document is called
the Lineage-linked GEDCOM form.  Other GEDCOM forms have been used for other kinds of
data, including several that are not related to genealogy.  The Lineage-linked GEDCOM form is
defined in chapter 2 and is the form used by commercial genealogical software systems for
exchanging compiled, linked information about individuals with accompanying source citations and
evidence records.  The other forms of GEDCOM are not publicly exchanged at this time, and are
not discussed in this document.

Changes in Version 5.x

Prior versions of The GEDCOM Standard were released in October 1987 (3.0) and August 1989
(4.0).  Versions 1 and 2 were drafts for public discussion and were not established as a standard.

This GEDCOM draft version (5.x) includes the first standard definition of the Lineage-linked form
of GEDCOM and also includes the first major expansion of the Lineage-linked form since its initial
use in GEDCOM 3.0.  The existing registered GEDCOM-compatible systems should still be able to
exchange most data with newer systems that use this version and will still be considered GEDCOM-
compatible for submitting information to the Family History Department. See chapter 2,
"Compatibility with previous GEDCOM releases", for compatibility detail.
There are several purposes for version 5.x of GEDCOM:

       *   Re-define the description of the GEDCOM data representation grammar in a shorter,
           more precise format, for ease of understanding (see chapter 1).  The GEDCOM format
           remains the same, even though the description of it is changed.

       *   Define the combinations of tags, values, and pointers allowed in the Lineage-linked form
           (see chapter 2).  This is the form of GEDCOM currently exchanged by commercial

           genealogical software systems, and it remains unchanged except for new tags and
           upward-compatible  structural extensions listed below.  (The Lineage-linked form should
           not be confused with other forms of GEDCOM, which apply the basic GEDCOM data
           format with different tag, value, and pointer combinations for other purposes.)

       *   Define representations for support information such as source citations, and or notes. 
           (See chapter 2 for suggested source citation structure in the Lineage-linked grammar.)

       *   Define additional EVENt and Role tags.

       *   Define user-defined ASSOciations with INDIviduals including direct family relationships.

       *   Require SOURce VERSion (product version) and GEDCom VERSion information in the
           HEADer record.

       *   Define DATE modifier (ABT, BEF, AFT, BET) and a more rigorously defined regular
           date format.
       
Some changes in Version 5.2 - 5.3 that were not in previous 5.x versions are:

       *   An address structure was defined to provide consistency to the addresses used in the
           many different structures.  The Phone number is now subordinate to address.

       *   A new tag for marrital status (MSTAT) at the time of an event was used added to the
           event structure.

       *   A mechanism for creating user-defined tags.  These are defined in a SCHEMA definition
           in the header record.

       *   The inclusion of the Unicode standard (ISO 10646) as an additional character set standard
           (see chapter 3).

       *   A MULTI_MEDIA_LINK structure was introduced to provide links to digitized video
           and sound files.

       *   The NAME tag used in the SOURCE_STRUCTURE was changed back to the TITLe tag
           to be used with the title of a book or article.

       *   The SOURCE_STRUCTURE was changed.  Compatibility may affect 5.x systems that
           was using the CPLR, XLTR, AUTH, INFT tags in substructures within the source
           structure.  See originator (ORIG) substructure for handling the name of the originator of
           the source data.
       *   Relocated all tags from the SUPPORT_INFO structure to the various structures where
           they specifically apply.

       *   Added the use of the FORM {FORMAT} tag in both the HEADER and
           PLACE_STRUCTURE.  The FORM tag in the header record subordinate to the PLAC
           tag indicates that all of the locality names are specified in a consistent hiarchy as
           specified by the value of the FORM.  For example; 2 FORM City, County, State. 
           GEDCOM 5.2 used the TYPE tag subordinate to the PLAC tag for this purpose.


GEDCOM Product Registration

Developers of GEDCOM-compatible products using the Lineage-linked form of GEDCOM (see
chapter 2) should register their product by submitting the following information to the GEDCOM

coordinator:

       *   A diskette containing a small sample of GEDCOM output from the product being
           registered.  This should be data which represents all of the fields managed by your
           system and that can be used for testing compatibility with other developer's systems.

       *   A proposed unique SOURce name in the GEDCOM header record to identify the product
           (not the company).  This name can be up to 40 characters long, allowing mixed upper
           and lower case, with no embedded spaces.  Use an underscore (_) to connect multiple
           words instead of spaces or a combination of upper and lower case letters i.e.
           FamilyRecords or Family_Records.  Family History reserves the right to require
           uniqueness within the first 10 characters of this name.

       *   An optional text file containing relevant technical documentation about the product's
           GEDCOM implementation.

GEDCOM Software Library

A library of unrestricted public domain source code, in the C programming language, is available to
help reduce the work required to achieve GEDCOM compatibility.

Chapter 1
                                      DATA REPRESENTATION GRAMMAR

INTRODUCTION

This chapter describes the core GEDCOM data representation language.

The generic data representation language defined in this chapter may be used to represent any form
of structured information, not just genealogical data, using a sequential stream of characters. 

CONCEPTS

A GEDCOM transmission represents a database in the form of a sequential stream of related
records.  A record is represented as a sequence of tagged, variable-length lines, arranged in a
hierarchy.  A line always contains a hierarchical level number, a tag, and an optional value.  A line
may also contain a cross-reference identifier or a pointer.  The GEDCOM-line is terminated by a
carriage return, a line feed character, or any combination of these.

The tag in the GEDCOM-line identifies the type of information contained in the line, in the same
sense that a field-name identifies a field in a database record.  This means that the data is self-
defining.  Tags allow a field to occur any number of times within a record, including zero times. 
They also allow the use of different or new fields to be included in the GEDCOM data without
introducing incompatibility, because the receiving system will ignore data which it does not
understand and process only the data that it does understand.

The hierarchical relationships are indicated by the hierarchical level number.  Subordinate lines have
a higher level number.  The hierarchy allows a line to have sub-lines, which in turn may have their
own sub-lines, and so forth.  A line and its sub-lines constitute a context or enclosure, that is, a
cluster of information pertaining directly to the same thing.  This hierarchical arrangement
corresponds with the natural hierarchy found in most structured information.

A series of one or more lines constitutes a record.  The beginning of a new record is indicated by a
line whose level number is 0 (zero).

A GEDCOM receiver system scans the input for expected information by looking for specific tags
and processing the associated values.  Unrecognized tags (perhaps from a sending system whose
database contains some different information) are handled by not processing the associated value nor
its enclosed sub-lines; that is, the entire context is ignored. These are treated as exceptions by
printing them in an exception report or saving them in some generic way.  Saved exception lines
may be recombined when the data is exported.

In addition to hierarchical relationships, GEDCOM defines inter-record relationships which allow a
record to be logically related to other records, without introducing redundancy.  These relationships
are represented by two additional but optional parts of a line: a cross-reference pointer and a cross-
reference identifier.  The cross-reference pointer "points at" a related record, identified by a
required, matching unique cross-reference identifier.  The cross-reference identifier is analogous to a
primary key in relational database terminology.


GRAMMAR

The grammar for the GEDCOM data format--a data representation language--is defined in this
chapter.  The grammar is a set of rules that specify what sequences of characters are valid
GEDCOM expressions.  The rules are expressed as a set of pattern definitions, where each pattern
is defined in terms of either a more primitive sub-pattern, or a constant.  Pattern definitions consist
of the pattern name, a separator (:=), followed by either a constant, a more primitive sub-pattern,
or a set of alternatives of these.  When a set is used, the alternatives are enclosed in square brackets

[] with the alternatives separated by a vertical bar ([alternative_1 | alternative_2]).  Only one is to
be selected.  The user can read the grammar components of the selected sub-pattern by substituting
any sub-patterns until all sub-patterns are resolved. 

A GEDCOM transmission consists of a sequence of physical records, each of which consists of a
sequence of gedcom_lines, all contained in a sequential file or stream of characters.  The
following rules pertain to the gedcom_line:

       *   The beginning of a new physical record is designated by a line whose level number is 0.

       *   Physical records are intended to be small enough to fit within a memory buffer of typical
           size, though absolute limits are not established.

       *   The total length of a GEDCOM-line, including leading white space and terminators, does
           not exceed 255 characters.  Long text can be represented by using CONTinue or
           CONCatenate tags.

       *   Leading white space (tabs, spaces, and extra line terminators) preceding a GEDCOM-line
           should be ignored by the reading system.  Systems generating GEDCOM should not place
           any white space in front of the GEDCOM-line (at least for the near future, see
           "Compatibility With Previous GEDCOM Versions" at the end of chapter 2).

       *   Level numbers must not contain leading zeroes which are not significant, for example,
           level one must be 1, not 01.

       *   GEDCOM-lines constructed with user defined tags must include a tag definition in the a
           schema substructure in the transmission header record.  The user defined tag must begin
           with an underscore (_).  The schema allows a receiving system to interpret the associated
           data.  (See the User Defined Tags section in chapter 2 for more information).


GRAMMAR SYNTAX

A gedcom_line has the following syntax:

    gedcom_line:=
         level delim  opt_xref_id  tag  opt_line_value  terminator 
       
        for example:
                               1 OCCU Teacher

    The components of the sub-patterns above are defined below in alphabetical order.  Some of the
    components are defined in terms of more primitive sub-patterns:

    alpha:=
     [ (0x41)-(0x5A) | (0x61)-(0x7A) | 0x5F ]
       Any ASCII letter: A-Z, a-z, and (_) underscore 

    alphanum:=
     [ alpha | digit ]

    any_char:=
     [ alpha | digit | otherchar | (#) | ( ) | (@) (@) ]

    delim:=
     [ (0x20) ]

       space_character

    digit:=
     [ (0x30)-(0x39) ]
       One of the digits 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9

    escape:=
     [ (@) (#) escape_text (@) non_at ]
      
    escape_text:=
     [ any_char | escape_text any_char ]
       The escape_text is coded to meet the rules of a particular GEDCOM form.  For the lineage-
       linked form the definitions are found in Chap. 2.

    level:=
     [ digit | level digit ]
       (Do not use non-significant leading zeroes such as 02.)

    line_item:=
     [ pointer | escape | any_char ]

    line_value:=
     [ line_item |    line_value  line_item ]

    non_at:=
     [ alpha | digit | otherchar | (#) | ( ) ]
 
    null:=
       () nothing

    opt_line_value:=
     [ null | delim | delim line_value ]

    opt_xref_id:=
     [ null | pointer delim ]

    otherchar:=
     [(0x21)-(0x22) | (0x24)-(0x2F) | (0x3A)-(0x3F) | (0x5B)-(0x5E) | (0x60) |
      (0x7B)-(0x7E) | (0x80)-(0xFF)]
    Any ASCII character except control characters (0x00 - 0x1F), alphanum, space ( ), number sign
    (#),  at character (@), and the DEL character (0x7F). 

    pointer:=
     [ "@" alphanum pointer_string "@" ]

    pointer_char:=
     [ non_at ]

    pointer_string:=
     [ null | pointer_char | pointer_string pointer_char ]

    tag:=
     [ alphanum | tag alphanum ]

    terminator:=
     [ carriage_return |     line_feed |   carriage_return line_feed |

       line_feed carriage_return ]



USAGE DESCRIPTION:

    alpha:=
       The alpha characters include the underscore which is used to link word pieces together in
       forming tag names or tag labels.

    any_char:=
       Any character except the control characters found in the range of 0x00 - 0x1F.  If an @ is
       desired as part of the line_value, it must be written in GEDCOM as a double @, ie., "3 doz.
       @  $20.00" must be stored as "3 doz. @@ $20.00".

    delim:=
       The delim (delimiter), a single space character, terminates both the variable-length level
       number and the variable-length tag.  Note that space characters may also be present in a
       value.

    escape:=
       The  escape is a sequence in the grammar used to specify special processing, such as
       switching character sets or calendars for date interpretation, or for indicating an inclusion of
       a non_GEDCOM data form into the GEDCOM structure. The form of the escape sequence
       is:
       @# escape_text @ non_at.
                      for example:
                      @#DJULIAN@.
       The non_at after the final at character (@) should be discarded if it is a space ( ). 
       Otherwise, it should be retained as part of the text following the escape.  Output systems
       should always place a space ( ) after the escape sequence.  

       The specific format of the escape sequence is defined for the specific GEDCOM form being
       defined. (See chapter 2 for the escape sequence definition for the lineage-linked form).  

    escape_text:=
       The escape_text is defined to meet the requirements of a particular GEDCOM form.  For the
       lineage-linked form the definitions are found in Chap. 2.

    level:=
       The level number works the same way as the level of indentation in an indented outline,
       where indented lines provide detail about the item under which they are indented.  A line at
       any level L is enclosed by and pertains directly to the nearest preceding line at level L-1. 
       The Level L may increase by 1 at most.  Level numbers must not contain leading zeroes
       which are not significant, for example level one must be (1), not (01).

       The enclosed subordinate lines at level L are said to be in the context of the enclosing
       superior line at level L-1.  The meaning of a tag (see tag below) is interpreted in the context
       of the tags of the enclosing line(s).  Take the following record about an individual's birth
       and death dates, for example:

              0 INDI
                1 BIRT
                  2 DATE 12 MAY 1920
                1 DEAT
                  2 DATE 1960

       In this example, the expression DATE 12 MAY 1920 is interpreted within the INDI
       (individual) BIRT (birth) context, representing the Individual's birth date.  The second
       DATE is in the INDI DEAT (death) context.  The complete meaning of DATE depends on
       the context.  (Note: the above example is indented according to the level numbers to make
       the concept more obvious.  In the actual GEDCOM data there is no indentation, just level
       numbers lined up vertically on the left margin).

       NOTE: Some existing systems provide an option to produce an indented GEDCOM output
       for user readability, using space or tab characters between the terminator and the level
       number of the next line to visibly show the hierarchy.  Also, some have suggested allowing
       extra blank lines to visibly separate physical records.  These features may be incorporated
       into the GEDCOM standard at some future time, but for now, such a change would render
       some existing systems incompatible.  Therefore, we recommend that new systems be
       prepared to discard extra carriage returns, line feeds, spaces and tabs immediately preceding
       the level number during input.  Output should still be constrained to level numbers without
       indentation or blank lines, until most receiving systems are prepared to deal with this change.

    line_value:=
       The line_value identifies an object within the domain of possible values allowed in the
       context of the tag.  The combination of the tag, the line_value, and the hierarchical context
       of the supporting gedcom_lines provides the understanding of the enclosed values.  This
       domain is defined by a specific grammar for representing a given GEDCOM form (see
       chapter 2 for Lineage-linked grammar).

       Values whose source information contains illegible parts of the value should be indicated by
       replacing the illegible part with ... (ellipses).

       Values are generally not encoded in binary or other abbreviation schemes for reducing space
       requirements, and they are generally constrained to be understandable by a typical user
       without decoding.  This is intended to reduce the decoding burden on the receiving software. 
       A GEDCOM-optimized data compression standard will be defined in the future to reduce
       space requirements.  Meanwhile, users may agree to compress and decompress GEDCOM
       files using any compression system available to both sender and receiver.

       The line_value within the context of a tag hierarchy of gedcom_lines represents one piece of
       information and corresponds to one field in traditional database or file terminology.

    opt_xref_id:=
       (See pointer.)
       The opt_xref_id is formed by any arbitrary combination of characters from the pointer_char
       set.  The first character must be an alpha or a digit.  The opt_xref_id is not retained in the
       receiving system, and may therefore be formed from any convenient combination of
       identifiers from the sending system.  No meaning is attributed by the receiver to any part of
       the opt_xref_id, other than its unique association with the associated record.  The use of the
       colon (:) character is also reserved.

    otherchar:=
     [(0x21)-(0x22) | (0x24)-(0x2F) | (0x3A)-(0x3F) | (0x5B)-(0x5E) | (0x60) |
      (0x7B)-(0x7E) | (0x80)-(0xFF)]
       Any ASCII character except control characters (0x00 - 0x1F), alphanum, space ( ), number
       sign (#),  at character (@), and the DEL character (0x7F). 

       If any of these characters appear in the level, xref_ID, or pointer segments of the GEDCOM
       line, then that substructure should be written to an exception file.  If any of these characters
       appear in the value segment and the proper escape processing has not been invoked, then

       they should be replaced by a (^) (0x5E) character, unless the character is a TAB (0x09)
       character which can be replaced with a space (0x20) character.  These changes should also
       be recorded on an exception file.

    pointer:=
       A pointer stands in the place of the context identified by the matching xref_id. 
       Theoretically, a receiving system should be prepared to follow a pointer to find any needed
       value in a manner that is transparent to the logic of the subsystem that is looking for specific
       tags.  This highly-flexible facility will probably be used more in the future.  For the time
       being, however, the use of pointers is explicitly defined within the GEDCOM form (Such as
       defined in Chapter 2).

       The pointer represents the association between two objects that usually reside in different
       records.  There can, however, be an association between objects within the same logical
       record.  If this condition exists it is indicated in the pointer record composition containing an
       (!) character that separates the parent record's cross-reference ID from the specific
       substructure's cross-reference ID which is at some subordinate level to the logical at level
       zero.  The cross-reference ID of the substructure subordinate to a zero level record is always
       composed of the Record ID number and the Substructure ID number, such as @I132!1@. 
       By including the Record Id number in the pointers which associate objects within a record
       will allow the GEDCOM processors to build the index only at the record level and then
       search sequentially for the appropriate substructure cross reference ID.

       Complex logical record structures are divided into small physical records to accommodate
       memory constraints, many-to-many relationships, and independent record creation and
       deletion.

       The pointer must match a corresponding xref_id within the transmission, unless the colon (:)
       character is present (future network reference to a permanent file record).  A pointer is
       given instead of duplicating an object, though the logical result is equivalent.  An expanded
       traversal of a record tree includes following the pointers to related records to some depth,
       and splicing those records (logically) into the resultant expanded tree. Pointers may refer to
       either records which have not yet appeared in the transmission (forward reference) or to
       records that have already appeared earlier in the transmission (backward reference).  This
       arrangement usually requires a preliminary pass to construct a look up table to support
       random access by xref_id during subsequent passes. 

    tag:=
       A tag consists of a variable length sequence of alphanum characters.  All user defined tags,
       that is tags used which have not been defined by the GEDCOM standard must begin with an
       underscore character. (0x95).  All user defined tags must be defined in the SCHEMA
       substructure of the HEADer record. 

       The tag represents the meaning of the line_value within the context of the enclosing lines,
       and contributes to the meaning of enclosed subordinate lines.  Specific tags are defined in
       Appendix A.  

       Although existing tags are only three or four characters long, systems should prepare to
       handle tags of any length. Tags will be unique within the first 15 characters.

       Valid combinations of specific tags, line_values, xref_ids, and pointers are constrained by
       the GEDCOM form defined for representing a given kind of information (see chapter 2 for
       the Lineage-linked form grammar).

    terminator:=
       The terminator delimits the variable-length line_value and signals the end of the 

       gedcom_line. The valid terminator characters are:
                       [     carriage_return |
                             line_feed |
                             carriage_return line_feed |
                             line_feed carriage_return ]

Examples:

    The following are examples of valid but unrelated GEDCOM-lines:

              0 @1234@ INDI
              . . .
              1 AGE 13
              . . .
              1 CHIL @1234@
              . . .
              1 NOTE This is a note field that is
              2 CONT continued on the next line.

    The first line has a level number 0, a xref_id of @1234@, an INDI tag, and no value.  The
    second line has a level number 1, no xref_id, an AGE tag, and a value of 13.  The third line
    has a level number 1, no xref_id, a CHIL tag, and a value of a pointer to a xref_id named
    @1234@.

                                        LINEAGE-LINKED GRAMMAR

INTRODUCTION

This chapter describes the specific tag, value, and pointer combinations used for exchanging
lineage-linked genealogical information in the GEDCOM format.  Lineage-linked data pertains to
individuals linked in family relationships across multiple generations.  The chapter also addresses
specific compatibility issues pertaining to previous Lineage-linked GEDCOM releases and contains a
sample Lineage-linked GEDCOM transmission.

The Lineage-linked grammar defined in this chapter is based on the general framework of the
GEDCOM data representation grammar defined in the Chapter 1.  The lineage-linked grammar
defines the GEDCOM form used by commercial genealogical software systems to exchange data. 
Other specialized GEDCOM-based grammars have been created for different uses.  These other uses
of the general-purpose GEDCOM data representation should not be confused with this specific usage
for lineage-linked genealogical data, as defined in this chapter as the only approved form of
GEDCOM exchanged by commercial genealogical software systems at this time.

LINEAGE-LINKED GRAMMAR ORGANIZATION

This Lineage-linked GEDCOM grammar is organized into three sections:

    * Record structure components
    * Substructure patterns         (Arranged alphabetically by substructure name)
    * Primitive elements                   (Arranged alphabetically by primitive name)

Structures and substructures are indicated by enclosing the structure name within double angle
<<brackets>>.  Primitive element patterns are enclosed in single angle <brackets>.

The definition of each structure consists of the structure name, a separator (:=), and the structure's
component pattern.  This pattern consists of (a) GEDCOM-lines composed of primitive elements,
and/or (b) substructures.  Some primitive elements consist of two or more alternative sub-pattern
choices.  These choices are shown by listing the alternative sub-patterns between opening and
closing square [brackets] and separating each choice with a vertical bar (|), meaning that exactly
one of the alternate substitutions must be selected.  Some definitions of primitive elements use the
definition of other primitive elements to complete their definition. This is shown by including the
name of the detailed element type inside angle <brackets> in the definition.

The number of sub-pattern occurrences allowed within a pattern is defined in an occurrence
definition in curly {braces} on each line.  This number indicates the minimum and maximum
number of occurrences allowed for a pattern component in the form {minimum:maximum}.  Note
that minimum and maximum occurrence limits are defined relative to the enclosing superior line. 
This means that a required line (minimum = 1) is not required in an instance where the optional
enclosing line is not given.  Similarly, a line occurring only once (maximum = 1) may occur
multiple times as long as each occurs only once under its own multiple-occurring superior line.

The level numbers for any sub-structure are represented as (n), (+1), (+2), and so forth, so that
they may be used in more than one place at different starting level numbers. In these cases, (n)
equals the level number where the pattern first appears, and the (+1) means one level greater than
level n, (+2) means two levels greater than level n, and so forth.

Unless stated otherwise, the only ordering imposed on GEDCOM-lines within an enclosure arises
when multiple opinions or other items are presented for which only one may be expected by a
receiving system.  For example, a person may have been known by more than one name, or
evidence may suggest a birth either in 1840 in New York or in 1837 in Pennsylvania.  In these
cases, the most credible or preferred information is listed first, followed by less credible or less

preferred items. The QUAY tag may also be used to show the preferred data (see appendix A). 
Systems that support only a single field within a context should use the first item in the list.

Conflicting dates or places of an event should be represented in separate event structures to provide
a place for the accompanying source citations, rather than place multiple dates or multiple places
under the same enclosing event.

Even though no other ordering is defined beyond the one described above, some GEDCOM
programming tools optimize performance based on the assumption that tags generally appear in a
typical order.  Therefore, sending systems are encouraged to present GEDCOM structures in the
same general order as the one given in these patterns, unless there is a reason to use a different
sequence. 

This form uses the tag TYPE as a subordinate tag to names, places, events, etc.  The intent of this
tag is meant to further define its superior tag for the viewer only, it is not intended to inform a
computer program how to process the data.  The difference between this value and a note value
would be that displaying systems should always display the type value when they display the
associated data.  Therefore, cautious consideration should be used in using the TYPE tag. 

RECORD STRUCTURES OF THE LINEAGE-LINKED FORM

LINEAGE_LINKED_GEDCOM:=
      This is a model of the Lineage-linked GEDCOM structure for submitting data to other
      lineage-linked GEDCOM processing systems.  A header and a trailer record are required and
      they enclose any number of data records.

      0  <<HEADER>>                                                       {1:1}           
      0  <<RECORD>>                                                       {0:M}           
      0 TRLR                                                              {1:1}           

      There are specific subordinate GEDCOM-lines that may be used as subordinate GEDCOM-
      lines to other superior GEDCOM-lines.  For example:
         1 BIRT
         2 DATE 02 Oct 1937
         3 QUAY 1
      In the above example QUAY at level 3 indicates how reliable or correct the birth date value
      is.  The QUAY tag applies to any tag that contains a value.  This tag is not shown in any of
      the structures but the reader and writer of GEDCOM should expect that the QUAY tag
      could be present as a subordinate tag to any tag that has an associated value.

HEADER:=
      The header structure provides information about the entire transmission.  The SOURce system
      name identifies which system sent the data.  The DESTination system name identifies the
      receiving system.  Submission to the Family History Department for Ancestral File is
      ANSTFILE. For LDS temple submissions it is TempleReady.

      referenced in a FAMily record as either a spouse or child, then this record must include a

      represented by using the ASSO tag in the individual record to point to the record of the
      associated individual.  The relationship or association is shown in the value field of the
      subordinate TYPE tag.

EVENT_RECORD:=
      This structure represents event-oriented evidence information that is claimed as a basis for a
      submitter's opinion expressed in Lineage-linked INDIVIDUAL and FAMILY records.  Event
      records define an event in terms of a what happened, where and when it happened, and what
      individuals are mentioned in the record.

      These event records in some cases will be the source for assertions made in compiling lineage-
      linked data. SOURce pointers to the bibliographic description of where this event information
      was recorded should be a part of this record.   
      Evidence records from historical sources are kept separate from opinion records created by the
      submitter.  The information contained in evidence records is not redundant with respect to the
      information contained in submitter's opinions, even when names, dates, or places are the
      same, because the authority for asserting the information is different.

      Roles of an event which pertain to the event itself are placed subordinate to the event tag. 
      Roles of individuals mentioned in the event which are relationship roles such as the
      "husband's father" is placed subordinate to the role tag of the groom.  For example, the
      minister at a wedding's role would be represented by the 0 EVENt-MARRiage-OFFIciator
      structure.  The father of the husband would be represented by the 0 EVENt-MARRiage-
      HUSBand-FATHer structure.

      data specific to the individual owning this event and not the data that belongs to the source in
      which this data was found.  For instance Immigration and Emigration events should use a
      reference a source structure to show the SHIP and PORT information concerning the event. 
      Roles of other individuals can be shown using the EVENt record.  A link to the event record
      can be made by using the SOURce structure to point to the EVENt record.  The event record
      in this case would be an evidence record supporting the assertions made in creating this event
      structure.

SOURCE_STRUCTURE
      The source structure represents the submitter's basis (justification) for the opinions asserted in
      a lineage linked transmission.  This information is used by other researchers to (1) determine
      how much confidence to place in the associated assertions, (2) compare new evidence to old
      evidence from prior research, and (3) locate and examine the evidence to make an independent
      evaluation of it.  If a source is not explicitly cited for a given context, the source is by default
      ascribed to be the personal opinion of the submitter, with no further basis for its credibility.

      The justification takes the form of a description of the source from which the evidence was
      obtained, and may include a machine-readable representation of the evidence itself, such as an
      image of a document or an extract of its contents.

      A given source may be the basis for many different assertions.  Thus, much of the information
      is the same for many different citations of that source, such as the publisher information; and
      yet, some of the information varies from one citation to the next, such as the page number for
      a specific item.  Consequently, the SOURCE_STRUCTURE includes a sophisticated
      mechanism for sharing general source description information that is common across multiple
      citations, while at the same time allowing more specific information to be more directly
      associated with individual citations.  All tags within the SOURCE_STRUCTURE participate in
      this approach.

      To implement the mechanism, the SOURCE_STRUCTURE includes a SOURce pointer that
      refers to another SOURCE_STRUCTURE containing more general information to be included
      in the citation.  This forms a chain of records, beginning within an individual or family record
      and ending in a source record that does not contain another SOURce pointer.

      A given tag may appear in more than one record along the chain.  In this case, the tag
      occurring in one link (source record) of the chain is said to shadow or supersede the same tag
      found in subsequent records of the chain.  A program looking for a particular tag (or tags) in
      the citation starts looking in the first record of the chain and continues looking in each
      subsequent record in the chain for the appropriate tag, succeeding when the tag is found or
      failing when the end of the chain is reached.  In effect, a complete logical source citation is
      the set of all tags of all records within the source chain, excluding shadowed tags.

      The chain may consist of only one SOURCE_STRUCTURE contained entirely inside an
      individual or family record, with no SOURce pointer leading out from the individual or family
      record.  More typically, the chain will begin in the individual or family record and end in an
      ordinary source description record.  Occasionally, a multiple volume source may be
      represented using a record in the middle of the chain for specific information about the
      volume.

      For example, in a multiple volume source where each volume covered a range of years, a
      volume description would contain the PERIod covered by the volume, and the more general
      description of the set of volumes would contain the PERIod covered by the entire set of
      volumes.  In assembling the complete source citation, the program would stop searching for
      the PERIod as soon as it found a PERIod tag, which in this case would be in the volume
      description.  In a multiple volume source where each volume covered a specific place as part
      of a larger grouping of places, the program would find the PLACE_STRUCTURE information
      in the intermediate volume description, and it would find the PERIod information in the final,
      more general description of the set of volumes.

      We encourage data entry systems to develop flexible entry screens which will prompt their
      users for information which will meet the minimum standards for citing sources.  At the
      minimum there should be an entry form for published sources and one for unpublished
      sources.  The elements below are marked if they were recommended by the National
      Genealogical Society as being a help in citing puplished (p) or unpublished (u) sources.

      underscore (_).

      0  <OLD_TAG_1>                                                      {1:1}

                /* always start user tag name with an underscore (_).*/        
      For example, two new user tags are to be defined as _HOSP and _NURS and placed
      subordinate to an individual's birth.  The user tag in context would be: (Example only)

         +1 BIRT
            +2 _HOSP
            +2 _NURS

      The resulting USER_TAG_SCHEMA, to be included in the HEADer record, would then look
      like the following:

      (Example only)

PRIMITIVE ELEMENTS OF THE LINEAGE-LINKED FORM

The fields sizes are to show the minimum recommended field length within a database that is
constrained to fixed length fields.  GEDCOM lines are limited to 255 characters.  However, data of
any length can be included in GEDCOM by using the CONCatenation or CONTinuation tag to
expand a field beyond the 255 limit.  These two tags are being used to extend text type messages
rather than extending, for example, a name line.  Text lines are used in ADDR, DSCR, NOTE,
SOUR, TEXT, etc.

ADDRESS_LINE:=                                            {Size=1:40}

    corresponding number, for example; 4 yr 8 mo 10 da.  The year is required, and listed first,
    even if it is 0 (zero).

ANCESTRAL_FILE_NUMBER:=                                   {Size=1:8}

DIVORCE_DESCRIPTOR:=                                      {Size=1:90}
    A word or phrase that commonly describes the kind of separation, such as  "divorce" or
    "separated", that took place between husband and wife.  The separation descriptor should use the
    same word or phrase and in the same language, whenever possible, that was used by the
    recorder of the event.

DIV_EVNT_TAG:=                                            {Size=3:4}
    [ ANUL | DIV | DIVF ]     (See Appendix B for additional Tags)

   [ @#A<AUXILLARY_FILE_REFERENCE> <AUXILLARY_SET_FORMAT>
    An escape sequence which allows for alternate data formats to be linked to a specific context
    within the GEDCOM file.  The linked data referenced is for special processing and is tied to the
    context in which the escape was issued.  For instance, data specific to Window's Object linking
    and embedding servers would be referenced in this manner.  See Chapter 6, "Microsoft
    Windows Programmer's Reference" for the format of the standard OLE data stream.  This
    allows the transmission of images, sounds, or other auxillary processing associated with the
    enclosing context.  The format of the escape sequence has only been designed for including data
    by referencing a specific file name.  This means that there will be an unique auxillary data file
    for each link.  In the future we may adopt a method of including all of the auxillary data in a
    single auxillary transmission file.  Other auxillary process formats may also be defined in later
    GEDCOM versions.

EVENT_CLASSIFICATION_CODE:=                               {Size=1:90}

EVENT_DESCRIPTOR:=                                        {Size=1:90}
    A descriptor that should be used whenever the EVEN tag is used to define the event being cited. 
    For example, if the event was a purchase of a residence, the EVEN tag would be followed by
    the phrase "Purchased Residence."   When this descriptor is used with any of the defined event
    tags, it modifies the basic definition of the associated tag.  For example the BIRT tag could be
    used in connection with an EVENT_DESCRIPTOR of "Stillborn" to modify the birth event as a
    stillborn birth.  An EVENT_DESCRIPTOR of "DEAD" shows a person is dead but the death
    date is not known.  The event descriptor should use the same word or phrase and in the same
    language, when possible, that was used by the recorder of the event.  Systems that display data
    from the GEDCOM form should be able to display the descriptor value in their screen or printed
    output.

EVENT_TAG:=           {Size=3:4}
     [ <IND_EVNT_TAG> | <FAM_EVNT_TAG> | <DIV_EVNT_TAG> ]

    A word or phrase that best describes the circumstances that created this family.  The marriage
    descriptor should use the same word or phrase and in the same language, when possible, that
    was used by the recorder of the event. Possible descriptor values include "Childbirth-
    unmarried," "Common Law," "Tribal Custom," for example.  Systems that display data from
    the GEDCOM form should be able to display the descriptor value in their screen or printed
    output. (See also <DIV_EVNT_TAG>.)

    name of HOSPITAL. This name should be a name that could be used as a field label for reports
    and screens.  The name may include underscore characters (_).

GEDCOM_FORM:=                                             {Size=1:15}

      PROB | WILL ]

    An individual event tag.  The EVEN tag must be followed by a TYPE and an
    <EVENT_DESCRIPTOR>. The <EVENT_DESCRIPTOR> is optional for the defined event
    tags, for example: 
                1 EVEN
                2 TYPE Farley Family Reunion
                1 BIRT
                2 TYPE illegitimate

    (See Appendix A for tag definitions or see Appendix B for proposed Tags.  These proposed tags
    have not been standardized.  They may be used as a value for the TYPE tag under the EVEN
    tag or under the appropriate approved event tags.  Appropriate means that the event should be
    processed the same as the selected superior tag)

    A nationally-controlled number assigned to an individual.  Commonly known national numbers
    should be assigned their own tag, such as SSN for U.S. Social Security Number.  The use of the
    IDNO tag requires a subordinate TYPE tag to identify what kind of number is being stored. For
    example:
       n  IDNO 43-456-1899
         +1 TYPE Canadian Health Registration 

NEW_TAG:=             {Size=3:15}
    A user defined tag that is contained in the GEDCOM current transmission.  This tag must be
    defined within the SCHEMA context in the HEADer record and its name must begin with an
    underscore (_).  The SCHEMA context defines the data associated with this new tag. (See tags
    LABL, DEFN, and ISA).

NULL:=                                                    {Size=0:0}
    convention that indicates the absence of any characters in the value including
    A  the null character (0x00) which is prohibited.

OLD_TAG_1:=                                               {Size=3:15}
    This is any tag defined by the GEDCOM standard and is used in the SCHEMA context of the
    HEADer record to show the context in which a new user defined tag is being used.  This tag
    always represents a tag which was used at level 0.

OLD_TAG_2:=                                               {Size=3:15}
    This is any tag defined by the GEDCOM standard and is used in the SCHEMA context of the
    HEADer record to show the context in which a new user defined tag is being used.  Old_TAG_2
    represents any tag at any level between level 1 and the level in which the new user defined tag
    resides. For example, 
   n SCHEMA
    +1 INDI  (zero level)
       +2 BURI
         +3 PLAC
                +4 CEME

    <REGISTERED_RESOURCE_IDENTIFIER>:<RECORD_IDENTIFIER>
    The record number that uniquely identifies this record within a registered network resource. 
    The number will be usable as a cross-reference pointer. The use of the colon (:) is reserved to
    indicate the separation of the 'registered resource identifier'(precedes the colon) and the unique
    'record identifier' within that resource (follows the colon).  In cases where the colon is used,
    implementations that check pointers should not expect to find a matching cross reference
    identifier in the transmission but would find them in the indicated database within a network. 
    Making resource files available to a public network is a future implementation.

PERSONAL_NAME:=                                           {Size=1:120}

    ]
    The surname of an individual, if known, is enclosed between two slash (/) characters. The order
    of the name parts should be the order that the person would customarily have used when giving
    it to a recorder. If part of name is illegible, that part is indicated by ... (ellipses).

    Examples:
       William Lee
       /Parry/
       William Lee /Parry/
       William /Lee/ Parry

    The jurisdictional name of the place where the event took place. Jurisdictions are separated by
    commas, that is, town, county, state or village, parish, country.  Receiving systems cannot
    assume that the nth locality position is necessarily a specific level of jurisdiction.  Some systems
    may include a PLAC context in the HEADer record which will specify the jurisdictional levels
    to the place names.  Missing intermediate jurisdictions is represented by adjacent placeholder
    commas.  If FORM value within the PLACe context of the HEADer record is present, then all
    levels of jurisdiction must be accounted in this way.  For example if the following was included
    in the header record:
       0 HEAD
        1 PLAC
         2 FORM city, county, state, country
    Then each place name would be expected to account for the four levels by using appropriately
    placed commas.

    A FORM tag showing a change to this default assumption shown in the HEADer record can be
    used subordinate to an individual place structure to show the variant jurisdictional levels.

    A place of origin that is not necessarily a birth place is shown by preceding the place name with
    the word "of."  Missing or illegible characters within a place name are indicated by ...
    (ellipses).

    place on a given date within the range.  The time period date indicates that the event or events
    cover or happened over the time period specified.

    The choice TO <DATE_REGULAR> indicates from an indefinite beginning to a specified
    date.

TIME_VALUE:=          {Size=1:10}
     [ hh:mm:ss.fs ]
    The time of a specific event, usually a computer-timed event, where:
    hh = hours on a 24 hour clock
    mm = minutes
    ss = seconds, (optional)
    fs = decimal fraction of a second, (optional)

TRANSMISSION_DATE:=                                       {Size=10:11}
    <DATE_EXACT>
    The date that this transmission was created.

TYPE_OF:=             {Size=1:20}
    A user-defined number or text that the submitter uses to identify this record.  For instance, it
    may be a record number within the submitter's automated or manual system, or it may be a page
    and position number on a pedigree chart.

USER_TAG_DEFINITION:=
    A formal description of the user defined tag.  This description can be used by the receiving
    system to give meaning to the user defined tags.  (See Chapter 2, User Defined Tags section.)

VERSION_NUMBER:=                                          {Size=1:15}
    An identifier that represents the version level assigned to the associated product.  It is defined
    and changed by the creators of the product.

XREF:=                                                    {Size=1:15}
    Either a pointer or a cross-reference identifier.  If this element appears before the tag in a
    GEDCOM-line, then it is a cross-reference identifier.  If it appears after the tag in a GEDCOM-
    line, then it is a pointer.  The method of delimiting a pointer or cross-reference identifier is to
    enclose the pointer or cross reference identifier within at-signs (@), for example, @I123@.  A
    XREF may not begin with a number sign (#).  This is to avoid confusion with an escape
    sequence prefix (@#). The use of a colon (:) in the XREF is reserved for creating future
    network cross-references.
XREF:ANY:=                                                {Size=1:15}

   A universal pointer.  It may point to any other cross-reference identifier type.   

XREF:EVEN:=                                               {Size=1:15}

    <XREF>
    A pointer to or a cross reference identifier of a note record.

    <XREF>
    Either a pointer to a REPOsitory, a SUBMitter, or an INDIvidual record, or a cross reference
    identifier of a repository record.

XREF:REC!ID:=                                             {Size=1:15}
    [ <FILE:REC!ID> | <REC!ID> | <!ID> ] 
    Enclosed in at-signs (@), this is a pointer to a context within a record.  Normally the pointer
    will only be used to point to role contexts within the current event record but the principle
    should allow the reference to a context within a specific record within a specific file.  The

    following are valid ways of representing this pointer:
   
   @FILE:REC!ID@  =       A pointer to a specific context <!ID>, within a specific record
                          <REC> within a specific file <FILE:>, that logically replaces  the
                          context containing the cross reference pointer. (Future.)

    @REC!ID@      =       A pointer to a specific context <!ID> within a specific record within the
                          current GEDCOM transmission.
   not valid:
    @!ID@         =       A pointer to a specific context <!ID> within the current record of this
                          GEDCOM transmission must also contain the record level pointer, such
                          as @I13!3@.

    Either a pointer to a SOURce, a SUBMitter, or an INDIvidual record, or a cross reference
    identifier of a source record.

XREF:SUBM:=                                               {Size=1:15}
    <XREF>
    Either a pointer to a SUBMitter, or an INDIvidual record, or a cross reference identifier of a
    submitter record.

YEAR:=                                                    {Size=3:4, Type=NUMBER}
    A numeric representation of the calendar year in which an event occurred.  

YEAR_ALTERNATIVE:=                                        {Size=1:1, Type=NUMBER}
    A year modifier which shows the possible date alternatives for pre-1752 date brought about by a
    calendar change, for example, 15 Dec 1752/3.

COMPATIBILITY WITH OTHER GEDCOM VERSIONS

Products based on GEDCOM 5.3 are generally compatible with products based on prior GEDCOM
versions.  However, there are four issues related to specific products that introduce incompatibilities
which can be accommodated by programming to handle the information in both the standard and the
non-standard way.  Compatibility with prior implementations may be maintained by doing the
following:

1.    Treat a TITL tag found at level 0 as if it were a SOUR record, including its subordinate
      structure.  Roots III points from a SOUR structure in an INDI record to a 0 TITL source
      record in this manner.  Likewise, the TITL tag must be used instead of the SOUR tag in the
      level 0 SOUR record to send source information to Roots III.

2.    The structure for LDS sealing of child to parents was changed in the standard from the FAM-
      CHIL-SLGC structure to the INDI-FAMC-SLGC structure to conform with the more natural
      access path to this information.  PAF 2.1 reads the sealing date in the FAM-CHIL-SLGC
      structure, while other products read it in the INDI-FAMC-SLGC structure.  To accommodate
      all implementations, systems handling the LDS ordinance events should look for the child
      sealing information in either place.  Systems should also write the child sealing information in
      both structures when preparing a transmission.  Other child events were also moved to the
      INDI-FAMC structure, namely ADOPtion, which should receive the same treatment.

3.    When an individual has multiple names, GEDCOM 5.x requires listing the preferred instance
      first, followed by less-preferred names.  However, PAF and other products take only the last
      instance during a transmission, causing the preferred name to be dropped when more than one
      name is present.  The same happens with all multiple-instance tags where only one instance is

      received.  When writing to GEDCOM 4.0 (or earlier) compatible systems you should only
      output the preferred name under the name tag and export the also-known-as name in a note
      field.

We anticipate a future change to allow use of indentation to make GEDCOM files easier to read. 
To make this transition easier, beginning with GEDCOM 5.3, leading white space in a GEDCOM
line should be handled by receiving systems by ignoring it.  Indentation should NOT be transmitted
in GEDCOM files until this change is established in a future version of The GEDCOM Standard.

PACKAGING THE GEDCOM TRANSMISSION FILE

The GEDCOM transmission is normally created on a DOS or Macintosh compatible diskette.  The
DOS filename extension is (.GED).  Macintosh filenames do not use file extensions.

When the GEDCOM file is too large to fit on a single diskette, the file is divided after any whole-
line (last character is the terminator), and the DOS filename extension becomes (G##) where (##) is
(00) for the second disk, (01) for the third, and so forth.  For Macintosh filenames, append the two
digits to the subsequent filenames in parentheses. (See example below.)  This allows the receiving
software to ensure that disks are read in the correct sequence.

Given that the user-supplied portion of the file name is SMITH, then the complete filenames for a
three-disk transmission would be:

Disk      DOS Filename         Macintosh Filename
  1       SMITH.GED                  SMITH
  2       SMITH.G00                  SMITH(00)
  3       SMITH.G01                  SMITH(01)

The required GEDCOM HEADer record appears only on the first disk and the required TRLR
(trailer) record appears only on the last disk and must be followed by the  terminator.

USER DEFINED TAGS
Data stored in different systems within a user defined context will not be easy to share between
other systems.  GEDCOM defines a schema that can be included within the HEADer record which
will give receiving systems the information to assist them in interpreting the user defined data. 
Utmost care should be taken when defining User tags.  The primary use would be for transmitting
data between the same software driven system, system developers are encouraged to find ways of
supporting user defined tags, but GEDCOM only provides a way to express the data, it usage is left
to the receiving software.

This schema is designed to show:
      a.  The context within which the new tag appears in the records.
      b.  The name of the new tag, which must start with an underscore (_).
      c.  The definition of the new tag.
      d.  The label or long name of the new tag, if different from the tag name.
      e.  The kind of data that this new tag represents in terms of a predefined standard GEDCOM
          tag. For Example, if HOSPital was being defined as a user tag, then we would use the
          SITE tag to show that hospital is a kind of SITE.

In the Sample Lineage-linked GEDCOM Transmission example below is the SCHEMA required for
defining a new user defined tag "_HOSP" which is intended to show the name of the name of the
hospital where a birth took place.

Included in the schema context is:
      1.  The LABL tag to define a longer tag name that can be used as a field label.
      2.  The DEFN tag which allows sharing of the definition of the new tag.

      3.  The ISA tag to show that this tag is a kind of another standardized tag.  In this case
          _HOSPital is a kind of SITE.

ESCAPE SEQUENCE FORMAT FOR THE LINEAGE-LINKED FORM

The Lineage-linked form utilizes the escape sequence feature provided in the GEDCOM grammar in
the following way:

      *  An escape sequence in the HEADer structure invokes variant processing for the entire
         transmission.

      *  An escape sequence that appears in subsequent structures affect only the line on which the
         escape sequence appears unless that line has subordinate CONTinuation or CONCatenation
         lines.  In this case the variant processing applies to the subordinate CONTinuation and
         CONCatenation substructure lines as well.

      *  The form of the escape sequence is @# escape_type_code escape_text @ where the
         escape_type_code indicates that:
                 A =     A auxillary data format or processing is being referenced.  Auxillary data
                         formats include such forms as images, sound, or other data requiring
                         auxillary processing. (See primitive element
                         ESCAPE_TO_AUXILLARY_PROCESSING above in this chapter).  

                 C =     Character set processing is being invoked.

                 D =     Date processing for special calendar is being invoked. (see primitive
                         element CALENDAR_ESCAPE_SEQUENCE above in this chapter).

         The escape_text specifies the specific processing to be done within that particular type, for
         example, @#DJULIAN@ indicates julian date processing.

SAMPLE LINEAGE-LINKED GEDCOM TRANSMISSION

The example below shows how some of these value types appear in a valid GEDCOM Lineage-
linked transmission.   The example is a sample transmission of genealogical information about three
individuals who are members of the same family--husband, wife, and child.  In the example,
"Joe/Williams/" is the value specified by the tag NAME under the INDI tag for the record (@3@). 
Other values in other lines, such as the birth date and place, provide additional information about
Joe Williams. The value (@4@) specified by the FAMC tag is a pointer to the FAMily record
(@4@) of which Joe Williams is a child. Included also in this transmission example are three other
record types: a source record, a submitter record, and a repository record.  These records are
pointed to from within other records in the transmission.  This shows how pointer values can be
used in creating the GEDCOM Lineage-linked form.

                                    USING CHARACTER SETS IN GEDCOM

INTRODUCTION

GEDCOM needs to be designed to accommodate different character sets to facilitate the sharing of
genealogical data in different languages.  In order to minimize the number of differing standards to
accomplish this, we have chosen to have each system convert their usage to ANSEL and eventually
UNICODE.   In January of 1991 a Unicode Consortium was founded to promote the use of the
Unicode standard which accommodates all characters in one character set (see the section on
Unicode below).  Unicode Consortium has agreed with the ISO 10646 standard to merge and
Unicode will be a subset of the ISO 10646 international character encoding standard.  The difficulty
is in handling the two character code sequences.  Therefore, until the multi-byte handling becomes
more common, the usage of ANSEL to represent the latin-based international characters will be the
standard.

The GEDCOM specification does not address the implementation methods for multilingual
processing, such as keyboard arrangements, sorting sequences, or character and graphic
representations (font styles, proportional spacing, and so forth) on the CRT or printers, however,
Unicode standard has defined formatting characters which will indicate the direction of the text
presentation as well as other text formatting character codes.

Most of the genealogy systems developed so far utilize either ASCII or ANSEL, or both.  ANSEL
accommodates the set of Latin-based languages, as explained below.    

8-Bit ANSEL

The 8-Bit ANSEL (American National Standard for Extended Latin Alphabet Coded Character Set
for Bibliographic Use, Z39.47, 1985 copyright) is the default character set for GEDCOM. It is used
for all transmissions of information unless another character set is specified.  The use of this
character set standard makes it possible to preserve the full integrity of the language by providing a
method of using the standard ASCII character set and supplementing it with both non-spacing
character modifiers (diacritic) as well as spacing special characters.  Non-spacing means that the
diacritic is printed without advancing the device's print position.  The character being modified is
then printed in the same position, resulting in a combined image of both the character and the
diacritic(s). The storage of ANSEL requires storing the non-spacing graphic character(s) preceding
the ASCII character that the diacritic is to modify.  The ANSEL standard specifies an extended 8-bit
configuration (above 128) to represent the spacing and non-spacing graphic characters that make up
most of the Latin based languages.  ANSEL is a super-set of ASCII.  The standard ASCII
characters including the control characters are preserved.

ANSEL is known by two other names: (1) ANSI Z39.47-1985) and (2) the American Library
Association character set, used in library systems worldwide, including the MARC (MAchine-
Readable Catalog) format.

A description of the codes for the ANSEL character set has been reproduced with permission and is
included with the printed version of The GEDCOM Standard. The description of ANSEL codes is
not included in the electronic version.  This description may be purchased from the American
National Standards Institute at 1430 Broadway, New York, N.Y. 10018. 
The description of the ANSEL character set standard includes the following:
       *       An 8-Bit Code Table showing the ASCII and extended ANSEL codes
       *       An explanation or legend of these codes
       *       A chart that identifies the ANSEL Non-spacing Graphic Characters
       *       A chart that identifies the ASCII Control Characters
       *       A chart that identifies the ASCII Graphic Characters

Character-set codes 0 through 127 are the same for 8-Bit ANSEL and 8-Bit ASCII (USA version--

ANSI 8-Bit). Character-set codes 128 through 255 are unique to the ANSEL character set.

ASCII (USA version)

When there isn't a need for diacritics or other special characters, and if you are not transmitting
binary data, you will find it convenient to use ASCII (8-bit USA version) if your computer already
supports it. This is a standard of the American National Standards Institute (ANSI). Most of the
basic printable characters of ANSEL and ASCII (USA version--ANSI 8-Bit) are identical.

Binary Character Set

Binary formats for representing photographs and other bit-mapped graphics should use the escape
sequence "escape_to_supplementary_processing" for linking supplementary files to the GEDCOM
context (see chapter 2).

UNICODE (ISO 10646)

The Unicode standard is a new character code designed to encode text for storage in computer files. 
It is a subset of the upcoming ISO 10646 standard.  The design of the Unicode standard is based on
the simplicity and consistency of today's prevalent character code set, extended ASCII code set, but
goes far beyond ASCII's limited ability to encode only the Latin alphabet: the Unicode encoding
provides the capacity to encode all of the characters used for written languages throughout the
world.  In order to accommodate the many thousands of characters used in the international text, the
Unicode standard uses a 16-bit code set instead of extended ASCII's 8-bit code set.  This expansion
provides codes for more than 65,000 characters.  The Unicode standard assigns each character a
unique 16-bit value, and does not use complex modes or escape codes to specify modified characters
or special cases. The text representation of the Unicode 16-bit numbers is U+0041 which is
assigned to the letter A, 65 decimal.  The Unicode standard includes the Latin alphabet used for
English, the Cyrillic alphabet used for Russian, the Greek, Hebrew, and Arabic alphabets.  Other
alphabets used in countries across Europe, Africa, the Indian subcontinent, and Asia, such as
Japanese Kana, Korean Hangul, and Chinese Bopomofo are included.  The largest part of the
Unicode standard is devoted to thousands of unified character codes for Chinese, Japanese, and
Korean ideographs.  (See "The Unicode standard", vol. 1 and 2, published by Addison-Wesley
Publishing, for character code standards.)

The Unicode character set environment, which contains a character set for all languages, minimizes
previous GEDCOM requirements to provide escape_sequences for moving from one character set to
another.  If the Unicode environment is used to produce a GEDCOM transmission, the header
record would also be in Unicode, requiring receiving systems to determine whether the transmission
is Unicode or ASCII before they could interpret the GEDCOM header.  This would be done by
reading the first two bytes of the transmission.  If the first two bytes are 0x30 and 0x20 then the
transmission will be in either ASCII or ANSEL as determined by the header record.  If the first two
bytes are 0x30 and 0x00 then the transmission should be processed as a Unicode transmission.
(Different platforms may reverse the position of the null byte, in which case the test would be for
0x00 and 0x30.)

How to change character sets

The character set for an entire transmission is specified in the character-set line of the header
record. 

       The example below shows the specification in the header record.

       Example:

       Lvl     Tag    Value
       0       HEAD
       1       SOUR          PAF
       2       VERS          2.1
       1       DEST          ANSTFILE
       1       CHAR          ANSEL

The character-set change remains in effect until the TRLR record is encountered at the end of the
transmission.

The lineage_linked form no longer makes use of the character escape_sequence to change a
character set context inside of the transmission.  Unicode does not require shifting from character
set to character set and we should encourage its use for multi-language support.

                                 LINEAGE-LINKED GEDCOM TAG DEFINITION

Introduction

Appendix A is a glossary of the tags approved for use with Lineage-linked GEDCOM. (See chapter
2 for an example of the tags in context that describes the Lineage-linked structure.)  Every tag must
be used within the context shown to ensure that all information transmitted by means of GEDCOM
is uniformly identified.

The tags vary in type, depending on their role or use in a transmission. They are used to identify
individuals, families, names, dates, places, events, roles, sex, sources, relationships, control codes
and other kinds of data for computers, computer programs, and computer systems.

Generally, the definition for each tag is broad enough to cover all uses of the tag. Any new tag
needed to extend the Lineage-linked form can be used for by a system that generates GEDCOM
output may be used and will not violate the Lineage-linked GEDCOM standard as long as the
context for the Lineage-linked GEDCOM grammar is not violated.  System builders using new tags
should register them and their definitions with the GEDCOM Coordinator at the address listed on
the title page of this document.  The Coordinator will evaluate the feasibility of including them as a
part of the next release of the standard.  Suggestions and proposed additions are welcome.

                                PROPOSED EVENT AND ROLE TAG DEFINITIONS

The additional event and roll tags below have not yet been standardized.  They are shown here in
this draft form to obtain opinions as well as definitions.  We will standardize as many as makes
sense by the time the draft is finalized.  The underscore '_' in front of the tags indicate the tags
which have not been standardized and should be structured as user defined tags complete with your
own definition and classification using the ISA tag.  The other tags, the ones with the asterisk '*'
have been standardized and defined in the 5.x Appendix A.  Tags not appearing in Appendix A are
not used in any of the lineage-linked structures of 5.x and were therefore dropped from the standard
approved list.

The following tables show the spacing and non-spacing diacritic characters that are contained in the
ANSEL set.  This table was added to give help to those receiving the machine version to the
GEDCOM standard.  The graphic characters shown are not always accurate, however the name of
the diacritic and the decimal equivalent should agree with the ANSEL standard. 

          C/R column refers to the column and row of the American National Standard  Z39.47-
          1985 showing the ANSEL character graphic and its 8 bit binary representation.

          wpcode column shows the Wordperfect (code page , character number) (1,2) chosen as the
          closest representation of the diacritic as shown in Wordperfect Appendix P. of version
          (5.1) 

          Dec column shows to the decimal equivalent for that diacritic as is used in the ANSEL
          character set.

          Name column gives the english name of the diacritic.

          example of use column shows an example of words using this diacritic.  For the non-
          spacing diacritic, this mark appears before the character in which it should be
          superimposed.
