!Help for !Riff 0.01 (14 Dec 1994)

!Riff generates random repeating patterns on an attached MIDI instrument.
A new note is added each time the pattern is played unless the note chosen
would be unharmonious in the position chosen for it.  Sometimes a section
of the pattern is copied to one or more other locations in the pattern,
possibly with a pitch shift and with channels interchanged.  Very
occasionally the pattern is cleared completely and the whole ghastly
business starts again, probably producing a different pattern.  The tempo
also changes randomly between certain limits.
 
!Riff displays the current pattern in a window.  There are no controls
except Quit.  All you can do to relieve the monotony is change the
instruments assigned to MIDI channels 1 to 4 or change the value of Seed%
near the start of !Riff.!RunImage.

!Riff requires a version 3 MIDI podule with the MIDI_FastClock SWI (mine is
version 3.14).

If you like this kind of infinitely boring music (I love it!) you should
hear "Drumming" by Steve Reich or anything by Philip Glass or Micheal
Nyman.  If you have any comments on this program feel free to mail me.
