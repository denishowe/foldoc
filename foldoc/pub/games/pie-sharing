I think Rev. Charles Dodgeson (Lewis Carrol) addressed this
years ago.  As I recall, his solution allowed players j (j > 1) to
pick the portion designed by player 1 in turn, if they took 
a hunk off it.  That is
	1) Player 1 slices pie in half
	2) Player 2 likes it, so he removes a portion of pie,
	 3) Player 3 likes it, so he decreases it again
CLearly the strategy for each player is to approximate 1/n + epsilon
to the best of their ability.  When they don't get a slice they were
working on, it is because epsilon was too large.

A what?  What's a Byznatine (or even Byzantine) generals' solution?

That ensures that each person is satisfied with his own share but the
new version of the problem requires that each person be satisfied that
nobody else has a better portion.

Player 3 may think that the 1-portion was too big but he has no chance
to object according to the above algorithm.

I believe the problem is insoluble because anyone who is not involved
in making a division can always veto it.  There is thus no incremental
approach which successively excludes people from the decision making.
This means that everyone must simultaneously agree to all divisions
but that is just a restatement of the problem.
