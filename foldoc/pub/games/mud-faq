FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS:  MUD Clients and Servers  

Disclaimer: The authors and sources of this document are generally biased towards TinyMUDs and their ilk, since we play them more. An attempt is being made to fairly cover every mud available.  

"What are clients?"
Clients are programs, usually written in C, that connect up to servers. Telnet is one such client program.  Many clients written for MUDs have special added bonus features through which they filter the output; most, for instance, separate your input line from the output lines and wraps words after 80 columns. Some also have a macro-writing capability which allows the user to execute several commands with just a few keypresses. Some allow you to highlight output coming from certain players or suppress it altogether.  Still other clients make the sometimes tedious task of building new areas a breeze.

"Where do I get clients?"
Listed below is a list of clients, and a site or two where they can   be ftped from. If the site is down, your best bet is to ask around. In general, ferkel.ucsb.edu (128.111.72.60) and ftp.math.okstate.edu (139.78.10.6) are good places to look.  

"Do I need a special operating system to run clients?"
Yep, you sure do. Most use BSD Unix, although there are clients which also run under SysV Unix with networking, VMS with either MultiNet or Wollongong networking, and there's even one for IBM VM, and a new one that runs on a Macintosh.

"What clients are out there, and how are they different?"
Here's a reasonable accurate listing of available clients. Please note that we have not tested each of these, and they're not guaranteed to   work for you. UNIX clients appear first, VMS clients next, miscellaneous clients last. EMACS clients for UNIX appear after those written in C.

  BSXMUD Clients  These clients run on various platforms, and allow the
                  user to be able to see the graphics produced by BSXMUDs.
                  For more information, contact vexar@watserv.ucr.edu.
                  For Amiga: requires a modem - amigaclient.lzh
                  For PC: requires a modem - msclient.lzh AND x00v124.zip
                  For X11: sources, version 3.2 - bsxclient.tar.Z
                  For Sun4: binary - client.sparc.tar.Z
                  Also available are programs to custom-draw your
                  own graphics for a BSXMUD: - muddraw.tar.Z

  A few quick definitions:
    Auto-login -- Automatically logs into the game for you.
    Hiliting -- Allows boldface or other emphasis to be applied to some
  text.  Often allowed on particular types of output (e.g. whispers), or
  particular users.  "Regexp" means that UNIX-style regular expressions
  can be used to select text to hilite.
    Gag -- Allows some text to be suppressed.  The choice of what to
  suppress is often similar to hiliting (users or regular expressions).
    Macros -- Allows new commands to be defined.  How complex a macro
  can be varies greatly between clients; check the documentation for
  details.
    Logging -- Allows output from the MUD to be recorded in a file.
    Cyberportals -- Supports special MUD features which can automatically
  reconnect you to another MUD server.
    Screen Mode -- Supports some sort of screen mode (beyond just scrolling
  your output off the top of the screen) on some terminals.  The exact
  support varies.
    Triggers -- Supports events which happen when certain actions on the
  MUD occur (e.g. waving when a player enters the room).  (This can
  nearly always be trivially done on programmable clients, even if it
  isn't built in.)
    Programmable -- Supports some sort of client-local programming.
  Read the documentation.


  Some of these clients are more featured than others, and some require
  a fair degree of computer literacy.  TinyTalk and TinyFugue are
  among the easiest to learn; Tcltt is more professional.  Caveat Emptor.
  Since many MUDders write their own clients, this list can never be
  complete.  As above, ask around.

"Is there any problem with running a client?"

  Not usually.  Clients can be large when compiled, especially if they
  have lots of nifty features.  They don't take up much CPU time at all.
  It is recommended that you ask your friendly systems administrator or
  other machine-responsible person if it's okay for you to install one
  on the system, if only for the reason that someone else might already
  have done so, and you might be able to save space by sharing with them.
  If there's a no games policy at your site, don't try to sneak by it with
  a client -- their activities are easily detectable.  Be good.

"Okay, I know a client is that which connects to a server.  What is a server?"

  ...That which is connected to by a client.  A server is a program which
  accepts connections, receives data, mulls it over, and sends out some
  output.  In the MUD world, the server keeps track of the database, the
  current players, the  rules, and sometimes the time (or the 'heartbeat').
  Servers are usually very large C programs which maintain a small-to-enormous
  database of the objects, rooms, players and miscellany of the MUD.
  Because of their size and their constant computational activities, servers
  can be extremely CPU-intensive and can even be crippling to any other work
  done on that computer.  Do not ever run a MUD server on a machine illicitly
  or without express permission from the person responsible for the machine.
  Many universities and companies have strict policies about that sort of
  behavior which you don't want to cross.

  Of course, people who don't know any better start up illicit MUDs all the
  time.  Apart from the possibility of losing all your work and energy to
  one press of a sysadmin's finger, there's no harm done to the player.
  But we must stress: running a MUD where you shouldn't can get you into
  a whole new world of hurt.  Don't take the chance, it's not worth it.




"My [client, server] won't compile!  What do I do?"

  Your first best bet is to check out the documentation and see if someone
  is listed as 'supporting' (i.e. generally responsible for) the program.
  If they are, send them a short, well-written e-mail note explaining your
  hardware and software completely as well as a transcript of the error.
  Do not post to the internet unless all other realistic options have been
  considered and taken -- generally speaking, most readers will not be
  interested in your dilemma and may get upset that you're wasting their
  time.  Since MUDs have probably been compiled on every single platform
  since the Cyber 3000, there's a good chance that asking around the
  subculture will get you the answers you crave.  Do not mail me.  I
  probably won't know.
