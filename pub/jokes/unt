The portions of the female that appeal to man's depravity
   Are fashioned with considerable care,
And what at first appears to be a modest cavity
   Is really an elaborate affair.

The learned academics who have studied Physiology
   Have made a close analysis of dames:
They have classified and annotated, all without apology,
   And given them all funny Latin names.

There's the Vulva, the Vagina, and of course the Perineum,
   And the Hymen which is often found in brides.
There's a host of little things there, you'll love them when you see 'em:
   The Clitoris and God knows what besides.

What a pity is it then that we common people chatter
   Of those mysteries to which I have referred,
And use for such a delicate and complicated matter
   Such a very short and vulgar little word.

Not for us the lengthy names worthy of Doctors of Divinity:
   Our methods are perhaps a little blunt.
We do not cloud the issue with meticulous Latinity,
   We call the whole affair a simple #unt.

For Man has made this useful and pleasure-giving article
   The topic of innumerable jibes;
And though the name is odd which we have given to the particle,
   It seems to fit the subject it describes.
