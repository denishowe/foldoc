Dear Ms. Wheeler,

Your name has been passed to us by the Credit Brokers Association, debt
collection department. In view of your present financial circumstances,
we thought it might be appropriate to tell you about the rather special
service which we offer. We hope you will not mind.

When our company was set up, last October, it had come to the attention
of our founder that many people were having trouble handling their
personal finances and were getting heavily into debt. Many of them were
resorting to desperate means to try to solve their problems, some even
took their own lives. It was to help this last group that our company
was started.

It is a sad fact that some people feel that their only course of action
is to throw their life away, to waste it in a pointless act of self
destruction. We think we can provide a better way. Through our contacts
with the waste disposal and poultry industries, we can arrange to have
your body squished up and fed to the ducks.

How much better, I'm sure you'll agree, to have your sad demise handled
by experts using the latest hi-tech squishing machinery and to go, happy
in the knowledge that your former problems, which once seemed so
insurmountable, will soon be just so much duck guano.

Don't delay ! Send off the attached form today and soon you and the
ducks will all be much happier !

Please squish me up and feed me to the ducks. I would like a

commemorative urn of duck guano to be sent to (name and address):
