        The Jabberwocky

Twas brillig, and the slithy toves
Did gyre and gimble in the wabe;
All mimsy were the borogoves,
And the mome raths outgrabe.

Beware the Jabberwock, my son:
The jaws that bite,the claws that catch;
Beware the JubJub bird,
And shun the frumious Bandersnatch!

He took his vorpal sword in hand,
Long time the manxome foe he sought,
Till rested he by the Tumtum tree,
And stood a while in thought.

And as in uffish thought he stood
The Jabberwock, with eyes of flame,
Came whiffling throught the tulgey wood,
And burbled as it came!

Through & through, and through & through
The vorpal blade went snicker-snack!
He left it dead, and with its head
He went galumphing back.

And hast though slain the Jabberwock?
Come to my arms my beamish boy!
O frabjous day, calloo callay!!
He chortled in his joy.

Twas brillig, and the slithy toves
Did gyre and gimble in the wabe;
All mimsy were the borogoves,
And the mome raths outgrabe.

Il brilgue: les toves libricilleux'
Se gyrent et frillant dans le guave,'
sont les gougebosquex,'
Et le momerade horgrave.'
