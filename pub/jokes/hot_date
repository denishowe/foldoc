This high school kid finally gets a date with the hottest chick in his school,
so he decides to go to the pharmacist to buy condoms.

He builds up his courage and walks up to the counter and says, "Can I have a
three-pack of condoms?  I have a really hot date tonight."

The pharmacist nods and puts the box on the counter.

The kid thinks again and says, "You know, better make it two packs, this chick
is really hot."

Again the pharmacist nods and puts down another box.  Our hero pays for the
condoms and leaves the store.  Now he's so excited about the date that he shows
up at the chicks house an hour early.  When his date answers the door she says,
"You know you're kind of early, we're just about to eat dinner.  You're welcome
to join us though."

So as there eating dinner, our hero is acting kind of strange.  He keeps
looking at the ceiling and reciting prayers.

After dinner, as their leaving for the date, the hot babe turns to our hero and
says, "You know, I had no idea you were so religous."

"Yeah, well I had no idea that your dad was a pharmacist!"
