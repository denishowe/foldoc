I am pleased to announce availability of the expanded 2nd Edition of:
 
                 Accessing The Internet By E-Mail
 
This special report will show you how to retrieve files from FTP sites,
explore the Internet via Gopher, search for information with Archie,
Veronica, or WAIS, tap into the World-Wide Web, and even access Usenet
newsgroups using E-MAIL AS YOUR ONLY TOOL.
 
Lots of new stuff as a result of comments from around the world.  Check
out the updated Net Goodies section!  I've tried to make the entire document
a bit friendlier and added info on European mail servers.
 
The document "ACCESSING THE INTERNET BY E-MAIL" is now available from an
automated mail server.  To get a copy, send e-mail to either address below.
 
To: LISTSERV@ubvm.cc.buffalo.edu (for US/Canada/etc.)
Leave Subject blank, and enter only this line in the body of the note:
  GET INTERNET BY-EMAIL NETTRAIN F=MAIL
 
Or: MAILBASE@mailbase.ac.uk (for UK/Europe/etc.)
Leave Subject blank, and enter only this line in the body of the note:
  send lis-iis e-access-inet.txt
 
You can also get the file by anonymous FTP at either of these sites:
 
At: ubvm.cc.buffalo.edu                 Or: mailbase.ac.uk
  cd NETTRAIN                              cd pub/lists/lis-iis/files/
  get INTERNET BY-EMAIL                    get e-access-inet.txt
 
If you prefer, you can Gopher to:  mailbase.ac.uk
>From the root menu, follow this path to get the file:
  Mailbase lists - K-O / lis-iis / Other files / e-access-inet.txt /
 
For WWW access here's the URL you need:
  gopher://nisp.ncl.ac.uk:70/00/lists-k-o/lis-iis/files/e-access-inet.txt
 
Regards,
Doctor Bob  <BobRankin@Delphi.Com>
