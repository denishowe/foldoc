There is another site that will do FTP by mail.

It is ftpmail@decwrl.dec.com. Send it a message containing just the word
help to find out how to use it. Perhaps people who post info about FTP
sites can add these details.

Perhaps it is worth pointing out that this is a service that should not be
abused (look what happened to BITFTP). You can generate yourself a awful
lot of mail if you are not careful.
