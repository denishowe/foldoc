Subject: Linux pronunciation
Date: Tue, 1999-08-31 13:56:36 -0700

I'd like you to have (and consider) the attached response to an
article in Linux Journal, September 1999, p. 14 (not online so I can't
send it to you).  The magazine did a web search for "Linux" and "Linus"
then analyzed in a table the most common phoneticizations of Linux,
commenting that "Linn-ucks appears to be the winner!"  My Letter to the
Editor, which follows, contains several historical facts which should
be considered when publishing a suggested pronunciation for Linux.

..............................................................

Hey, kids, let's change some of the C language!  Yeah,
sure, let's just decide to replace some words with our
own words.  What?  What do you mean we can't do that?

I'm sure it's obvious to everyone that a few people can't simply
change a portion of a widely agreed language or standard.  What
stuns me is how the computer community -- so savvy about its own
standards -- widely ignores the existing standards of English
grammar and pronunciation.  Your September article surveying
pronunciations of Linux recorded on the Web, while an interesting
survey of contemporary pronunciation, demonstrates this common
ignorance.  But it did contain one valuable revelation.

English pronunciation has rules, just as any computer language
does.  Although imperfect, they are necessary to help avoid the
language descending into chaos, and to help readers know how to
pronounce words.  In Standard English pronunciation the second
vowel "u" makes the first vowel "i" long.  Thus in the word "line"
we do not say "linn-ee."  (Indeed, in this example, the "n" is
doubled to indicate that the vowel is a short "i" pronounced "ih,"
so if we were discussing "Linnux" the first vowel would be short.)

The article's revelation that Torvalds was named after the American
scientist Linus Pauling puts the final nail in the coffin for the
"Linn-ucks" camp.  Linus has always been pronounced "Line-us"
because the name was absorbed into English, and became pronounced
according to the rules of standard English pronunciation.  No one
ever called Dr. Pauling "Linn-us."  Even in its original language,
the name was NEVER pronounced with a short "i", as "Lih."

Readers should note that Linus Torvalds, Maddog and several others
from the early days adhere to their own pronunciation which I have
not seen noted elsewhere.  As clearly heard at LinuxWorld during
their speeches, they actually pronounce Linux as "Linnix," not
"Linnux."  This may result from the OS's origin in the OS Minix
and the "ix" in Unix.  (Note that we do not say "Oo-nix.")

The manner in which this debate has proceeded is significant.  At
LinuxWorld, vendors were heard loudly mocking attendees who innocently
used their English language background and correctly pronounced the OS
as "Line-ucks."  Along with the author of your article, many seem to
feel that pronunciation is simply "received," meaning that the way
they hear many individuals pronounce it makes it right.  This is
obviously not true.  Although English is a living language, we are not
freed from the duty of occasionally weeding the verbal garden.

A worse example is the common mispronunciation of the word "router"
as "raowter."  The word comes from the French phase "en route,"
pronounced "on root."  Until the mid-1980s, the standard American and
English pronunciation of this word was "root," as evidenced by the
pronunciation of the popular US television show "Route 66."  When
Local Area Networks became common technology, introduced by companies
populated with engineers from the American South and West, the origin
of the word and its correct pronunciation were displaced by the
Southwestern regional pronunciation, which has now infested even
television shows such as Star Trek Voyager ("Re-raowt power to the
shields!").  To adopt this pronunciation is to deliberately bury the
history of the phrase.  (Clearly the show's producers do not realize
how bizarre this pronunciation sounds outside the American Southwest.)

It is understandable that many individuals with a strong
engineering and computer background are weak in English, just
as many with a background in languages are weak in mathematics.
One can sympathize with their plight since standard English
pronunciation is infrequently or poorly taught these days.  But
it is impossible to sympathize with the authors of many key
documents in our industry such as the foundation documents of the
Internet, the Requests for Comments (RFCs).  From the beginning,
these documents are full of spelling and grammatical errors, yet
each came from academic or commercial organizations large and
sufficiently prosperous to afford editing and proofreading
services.  Had they understood the errors of their linguistic
ways, these scientists would surely have behaved differently.

So this is how the debate has proceeded -- without background,
investigation or scholarship.  Your article concludes that the
web survey of pronunciations is "inconclusive" and that the
pronunciation "Linn-ucks" appears to be the winner.  Winner?
Correct pronunciation is no contest.  At least those in the industry
responsible for using the English language to discuss the languages
of computers should accept their responsibility to make this clear.

It's "Line-ucks," and you've helped prove it. :-)

To my knowledge, no one is saying Lee-nucks, except that if the
pronunciation was based on the Finnish pronunciation of Linus,
that would be correct, which was my point.  Since Torvalds was
named after Linus Pauling, I believe this substantiates my
claim that Line-ucks is the correct pronunciation.  (I think
this should be added to your final paragraph.)  In that, I
participate in a miniscule minority.  So miniscule that Linux
Journal has maintained radio silence on my transmission.

Strangely, the vast majority of computer types express
puzzlement when they hear that English has some rules of
pronunciation.  This is not a strange concept when it comes to
dialects of C, for example, where they unquestioningly accept
standards and authorities.  But as for English, they widely
assume that it is first come, first served, and pile on!

You're welcome to publish my article (actually an unpublished
Letter to the Editor).  I object to this widespread stupidity
sufficiently to want the issue kept alive somewhere on the Web.

Your first paragraph finds me at a disadvantage.  I'm not sure
what /li: sounds like.  Every dictionary I have appears to
have a different method of marking pronunciation, and worse,
some of them publish the common east coast American dialect,
instead of the standard pronunciation based on the spelling,
which is closer to English Canadian and Englandischer English.

(For your possible amusement, my favorite example is "buouy"
and "buoyancy."  In America, common clods say "boo-ee"
instead of "boy" and become confused when reading the word
"buoyancy," trying to pronounce it as "boo-ee-an-see.")

Bob (Ethernet) Metcalfe writes in InfoWorld, 1999-11-11, p.110
that the "X" in Linux comes from MIT's Multics TSO, but I read that
Linus was working with Minix before he decided to start his own OS.
I've e-mailed Metcalfe <metcalfe@idg.net> asking for a source.

Later, I hope to extract from Linus and Maddog an admission that, like
the authors of RFCs, the key documents of the Internet, they never
bothered to consult someone with a background in English (or even a
spell-checker), and that IN THEIR MINDS, they were thinking of Linnix
(as a variant of You-nix), and not Line-ucks (as a variant of Linus
U.X.), and simply misspelled the word.  During their talks at San Jose
LinuxWorld, both of them repeatedly said "Linnix."

Re your list of current support for Linux, I just attended SGI's
Linux University here in Los Angeles.  They are going ahead like
their lives depended on it (which it does), and the number of major
database vendors releasing Linux versions grows daily.  So I'd
suggest not mentioning a few major vendors, as this list looks
badly outdated even today.  The juggernaut is upon us already.
Windows begins its slide into obsolescence once 2000 is released.

My understanding of the "X" is that it came from Minix.  In fact, if
you listen closely to Linus and Maddog, they say "Linnix" not "Linux."

Can you refer me to documentation or a source
regarding Multics and the origin of Linux?

You'll have to check with the experts, but Unix is a play on
Multics, and Linux is a Unix clone written by Linus Torvalds,
hence Linux, so the X from Linux comes from Multics.

Hmmm ... a thin argument, I think, since he was apparently unaware of
Minix's role in this linguistic multibabble.  But it's interesting to
hear that Unix is a play on Multics.  Have you heard that before?

Subject: Pronunciation Dogma

I am responding to a Letter to the Editor that is referenced in the
Linux entry regarding pronunciation.  I know it's old, but I just
came across it, and it pains me.  The pain is caused by seeing
self-professed purveyors of Standard American English Grammar a) Spout
their doctrine as if they get to determine which rules do and do not
apply and therefore how a word should be pronounced, and yet b) have
a very incomplete understanding of what they're spouting about.

Here's an excerpt:

It would indeed be lovely if this were true one-hundred percent of the
time.  Yet, at best, English orthography (written English, which is
really what we're talking about here) is only about 80% predictable.
I'm quite certain the person quoted above would not pronounce 'linen'
as 'line - in' (also see 'lipid', 'livid', 'limit', etc).  In fact,
when teaching phonics to people learning to read, the rule is
typically stated 'vowel - consonant - e' makes the vowel long, and
note that this even more stringent rule is still broken by 'linen'.

When English readers are faced with a novel word with the consonant-
vowel-consonant-vowel-consonant (CVCVC) shape, they have two
equally legitimate options for parsing the word and deciding which
print-syllable gets the middle consonant.  If they decide to parse
it as CVC VC, then the first vowel is 'short' ('ih', in this case).
If they come up with CV CVC, then the first vowel is 'long' ('eye').
As far as I know (and this is a year and a half since that letter
was written), it seems the people have chosen 'lih-nuhks'.

Additionally, even the hip-geek diatribe of "Hey, Linux is derived
from Linus, so it's 'line-uhks'", smacks of typical Americocentric
uninformed elitism.  If you were to ask Mr. Torvalds which was a
closer pronunciation of his name, 'line - us' or 'lih - nus',
I'm 99% positive he'd pick the latter, as the 'ih' and 'ee' are
extremely similar in articulation and thus acoustic pattern.  The
'eye' is a diphthong, which is acoustically quite distinct from /ih/
and /ee/ due to its starting out as the /a/ vowel as in 'father'.
Should American bastardization of the name Linus determine
the pronunciation of Linux for the rest of the world?  Nope.

Oddly, what it all comes down to is that rules just won't
(didn't) matter, because the rules have no clear result.  Because
this word was primarily distributed first via text, without an
accompanying spoken model or prior precedent of pronunciation,
the various communities of users each determined their own
pronunciation (dialectal variation).  If one final form has come
out, then it was determined by the dominant group (I believe it's
called 'peer pressure').  As the grammarians have always been
so loath to admit, mob rules when it comes to spoken language.

Well, yes, there are rules for spelling/pronunciation in english.  I
don't think anybody debates that really.  The thing we often forget
is the exception to the rule.  For almost every rule there is an
exception.  The fact that Linux is not a word at all though places
this debate in another ballpark so to speak.  If "Linux" had been a
word that desribed something or suggesting action as an adjective
or verb it would be different but in truth we are talking about a
proper name not a word.  I may be wrong here as I am no college
graduate, but I believe that this removes any pronunciation
limitations and definite pronunciation can only be truely set by its
creator.  This then would be a matter for Linus Torvalds to answer.
If this was not so then my family name's pronunciation could be
set by a committee of people I have never met many states away
in a debate similar to this one.  I dislike that idea very much.

P.S. Please add this dialog to the page at:
http://foldoc.org/pub/linux-pronunciation
as I am very interested in hearing others thoughts on my point as well.

Thank You

[Every six months it seems someone has to drop his or
 her eyes on this page, now it's apparently my turn :) ]

I've seen arguments all over the net about the pronunciation of the
word "Linux".  First of all, since I'm Spanish, I DO have to complain
about the "Americanization" of that word.  Isn't it Finnish?
Why are you discussing about ENGLISH pronunciation and grammar?

Anyway, the right pronunciation is /linnuks/.  Not because I say so,
because Linus does.  Some years ago he released a recoding, a short
.wav, with the word "Hello, my name is Linux Torvalds, and I
pronounce Linux as Linux".  You could clearly hear /linnuks/ (or
/li:nux, I don't really care, I just hate the "Line-us" thing :) ).

I'd like this to be posted on
http://foldoc.org/pub/misc/linux-pronunciation
if possible.  Thanks.

The word "Linux" was absorbed into English, therefore it is
being discussed as part of the English language.  It is
customary for languages to adopt foreign words and to adapt
them to their own rules.  I am sure this holds for Spanish too.
