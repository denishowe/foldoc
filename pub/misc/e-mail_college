This is a summary of how to find email addresses for undergraduate and
graduate students, faculty and staff at various colleges and universities. If
your university is not listed, send me a detailed description of how to find
email addresses there and I'll add it to this list. Please mail ADDITIONS,
CORRECTIONS, SUGGESTIONS, and OTHER INFORMATION to me at
	dalamb@qucis.queensu.ca.
I will *not* answer requests for help finding a specific address; if the
school is not listed in this posting, I probably do not have any information
about the site, and certainly do not have the time to answer the mail.

An updated version of this list is posted every once in a while to the
newsgroups soc.college, soc.net-people and news.answers.  The version date for
this list is located at the top of the file. The list is also available via
anonymous ftp from ftp.qucis.queensu.ca (host 130.15.1.100) in the directory
pub/dalamb/college-email as the files faq1.text, faq2.text, and faq3.text.
You can also get the file by anonymous ftp from rtfm.mit.edu (18.172.1.27) in
the file /pub/usenet/soc.college/Student_Email_Addresses, or by sending a mail
message to "archive-server@qucis.queensu.ca" with the subject
	send dalamb/college-email
or by sending a message to "mail-server@pit-manager.mit.edu" with the subject
	send usenet/soc.college/Student_Email_Addresses

A copy of this file may be found on the WAIS server at wais.cic.net,
thanks to Edward Vielmetti (emv@msen.com, emv@cic.net).

After a discussion of general facilities for locating email addresses,
we present detailed information on locating the email addresses of
students, faculty and staff at various universities.  As of Feb 1993 I've
started to tag entries with the date I last changed them, so you have some
clue as to how stale the information might be.

Disclaimer: Most universities have restrictions on the uses of
directory information. So don't use this info for commercial purposes
or whatnot without securing permission from the individual colleges
and universities.

;;; ********************************
;;; General Facilities *************
;;; ********************************

There are several general facilities for locating an email address.
We concentrate on those usable from the internet.

o  finger

   Finger is a user information lookup program that lists the login name,
   full name, office location and phone number (if known), login time,
   idle time, time mail was last read, and the contents of the .plan and
   .project files from the home directory of current UNIX users. The 
   information listed varies from site to site, and not all sites allow 
   remote fingering. [Plan files are "sys$login:plan" on VMS systems.]

   To use finger, simply call finger as follows
	finger <username>@<machinename>
   replacing <machinename> with the name of the appropriate machine, and
   <username> with the name of the person or the person's login ID.
   For example,
	
	% finger mkant@cs.cmu.edu
	[CS.CMU.EDU]

	[ Forwarding mkant as "mkant+@a.gp.cs.cmu.edu" ]

	[A.GP.CS.CMU.EDU]
	Login name: mkant                       In real life: Mark Kantrowitz
	Directory: /usr2/mkant                  Shell: /usr/cs/bin/csh
	Last login Tue Apr  2 15:21 on ttyQ7 from LION.OZ.CS.CMU.EDU
	No new mail, last read on Thu Apr 11 16:27

   Notice how fingering my userid at the generic address forwarded the
   request to the correct machine. Many universities are set up to do
   forwarding in this manner, so that mail may be sent to the generic
   address and is automatically forwarded to the maildrop on the machine
   where the user receives his or her mail.

   Fingering using last names or full names may work, depending on the
   site:
	% finger Mark.Kantrowitz@cs.cmu.edu
	[CS.CMU.EDU]
	[ Forwarding Mark.Kantrowitz as "mkant+@a.gp.cs.cmu.edu" ]

	% finger kantrowitz@cs.cmu.edu
	[CS.CMU.EDU]
	[ Forwarding kantrowitz as "mkant+@a.gp.cs.cmu.edu" ]
   Some sites with use an underscore (_) instead of a period (.) in the
   full name (e.g., Mark_Kantrowitz), or require an extra period to
   specify middle initials (Mark.X.Kantrowitz).

   If fingering using the last name doesn't work, you can try sampling
   various possibilities for userids. The following are some
   possibilities. After the description of each possibility, I give
   an example in square brackets with either the previous maintainer's name
   (Mark Kantrowitz, no middle initial - his was longer than mine!) or "John C
   Smith", and a generic acronym for the method, with f's for characters from
   the firstname, m for the middle initial, and l's for characters from the
   lastname; these acronyms will be used in the detailed listings section of
   this file.
	-  Many UNIX sites limit userids to 8 characters, so try the
           first 8 characters of the last name. [smith or kantrowi] llllllll
	-  If there are two people with the same last name, the first
           initial (and possibly the middle initial as well) are appended
	   at the front of the name. [jsmith or jcsmith] flllllll fmllllll
	-  Try appending the initials at the end of the name. [smithj
 	   or smithjc] lllllllf llllllfm
	-  Try the initials of the users name. [jcs] fml

   Unfortunately, you cannot finger to bitnet addresses.

o  whois/nicname				Changed: Tue Feb 23 1993
   
   Whois is the internet user name directory service. Do 
	whois help
   or
	nicname -h
   to get a help message. The whois and nicname programs will check
   the database maintained by SRI-NIC (Network Information Center
   at SRI International) for the given names. For example,
	nicname <name>
   or
	whois <name>
   or
	whois -h <host> <names>  (e.g., whois -h stanford.edu <names>)
   This is only useful for people listed in the database. Many regional
   networks and some universities maintain their own NICs.

   You can also get some of this information by telneting to nic.ddn.mil
   and running whois and host there.

o  Merit Network NetMail database
 
   Allows one to find the appropriate bitnet, internet or uucp address
   for a site given part of the address.
	telnet hermes.merit.edu
	At the "Which Host?" prompt, type netmailsites
	then enter any part of the address you want.

o  nslook/nslookup and hostq programs
   
   Some sites have programs which will give you information about a host
   given its name or IP address. Some such programs include nslook,
   nslookup, and hostq.

o  Netfind

   Use a netfind client or server program to search for
	name domain
   where name is the last name of the individual and domain is the
   domain name. You can use Netfind by telnet/rlogin to
   bruno.cs.colorado.edu (use userid "netfind" with no password).

o  help/gripe/olc

   If your site has consultants or facilities staff responsible for helping
   users/fixing bugs/maintaining software, try sending them mail. Often
   they will be able to help you. If you don't know how to contact these
   people, ask someone in your department, or try sending mail to the
   userid 'help'.

o  postmaster						Changed: Tue Feb 23 1993

   Most sites have an individual responsible for network and mail operations
   at the site, usually with the userid of 'postmaster'. So if you're having
   trouble with mail, first send mail to postmaster at your site, and if
   that fails, try sending it to postmaster at the destination site. 
   Postmasters are usually very busy people, so try not to bother them much.
   Many postmasters will refuse to answer questions about user identification,
   for reasons of privacy.

o  /etc/hosts						Changed: Mon Feb 15 1993

   Mail routing on UNIX machines on the internet use to use a large file
   called /etc/hosts to validate host names.  We used to advise you to examine
   this file to guess host names when all else fails - but that really isn't
   useful anymore.  Use one of the above methods instead.

o  LISTSERV

   If the person is subscribed to a mailing list through a LISTSERV server,
   sending mail to the server with the line
	WHOIS <name>
   may catch the person. For example, listserv@buacca.bu.edu. This is an
   unlikely option. It also does not work with all listserv implementations.

o  Internet to America Online

   Creating the Internet version of an America Online address requires that
   you know the conversion rule. You ignore the case, remove the spaces, and
   add "@aol.com" to the end of the address.  Thus, an America Online address
   "Jane Doe" becomes "janedoe@aol.com" (without the quotes, of course).
   Internet mail incoming to America Online is trucated at 27 kilobytes.


;;; ********************************
;;; Miscellaneous Notes ************
;;; ********************************

Addresses on the United Kingdon academic network (JANET) have their components
reversed. For example, @uk.ac.dund.mcs works on JANET, but in the rest of the
world use @mcs.dund.ac.uk instead.

;;; ********************************
;;; Email Database *****************
;;; ********************************

Amherst College:
	Students, Faculty, Staff: userid@amherst.edu	
	Usernames are of the form fmllllll (e.g., jqstudent), but
	truncated to 12 letters instead of 8.

	Amherst.edu has a finger daemon running, but it requires an exact
	username match (i.e. finger lastname@amherst.edu) doesn't work, as a
	rule.  It's also worth trying usernames like flllllll in case the
	person in question didn't register their middle initial with the
	College.


Antioch College (Yellow Springs, OH):

	Flastname@Antioc.Antioch.Edu

	All students, faculty, administrators, staff, and alum who request
	accounts can get them.  Almost all follow First Initial lastname
	setup.  Offices, such as ADMISSIONS, COOP etc have alias accounts.
	Best bet is to send mail to Postmaster or Laslow.

Arizona State University:
	Academic Machines: Grad, Undergrad
	The phone book for ASU's Faculty/Students is available online
	by telnetting (using the IBM's fullscreen interface using
	tn3270) to asuvm.inre.asu.edu and logging on as HELLOASU. The
	phone book has both email addresses for academic machines as
	well as the phone nos. (602 is the area code for all of Arizona)

	Engineering machines: Grad, Undergrad
	enuxha.eas.asu.edu   -- Unix -- can finger first/last names or userids
	enuxva.eas.asu.edu   -- Unix -- same as above 
	envmsa.eas.asu.edu   -- VMS  -- Only userid fingering works. 

	Usually csc and eee undergrads who use comps get accts on
	enuxha and almost all grads have accts on enuxha which is the
	most popular machine due to USENET. 

Auburn University: (Auburn, AL)
	Engineering: eng.auburn.edu
	Other departments: ducvax.auburn.edu
	Try fingering at waterman.eng.auburn.edu, lab1.eng.auburn.edu,
	newton.eng.auburn.edu or netman.eng.auburn.edu.

Ball State University:
	University Computing Services: username@bsuvax1.bitnet
	Some faculty and grad students have accounts on this machine.
	CS: username@bsu-cs.bsu.edu

Barnard: See Columbia.

Bates College (Lewiston, Maine):
 	Students and Faculty: userid@abacus.bates.edu
	Userids are of the form flllllll.  Numbers are added to the end
	of the userid in case of name conflicts, e.g. asmith, asmith2, asmith3
	If the name is unique you can use firstname.lastname@bates.edu

Baylor College of Medicine:

	The central mail server is bcm.tmc.edu and finger user@bcm.tmc.edu will
	get you any faculty or staff user that makes use of the central mail 
	facility. finger user@express.bcm.tmc.edu will get you any student that
	makes use of the student email facility.

	whois -h whois.bcm.tmc.edu gets you the on-line phone/address book.
	This is directly tied to the BCM personnel database, so the information
	is as accurate as possible.

	Questions about these facilities should be directed to
	postmaster@bcm.tmc.edu

Birmingham-Southern College (Birmingham, AL):
	bsc835!userid@uunet.uu.net where userid are of the form
	flllllll. Postmaster is bsc835!jbaxter@uunet.uu.net.
	
Boston Univ.:
	Main campus system: acs.bu.edu.  Everyone can get accounts on this
	machine, but not everyone does. Call the person and ask (they may
	never log on even if they have an account). Student Directory
	617-353-3700, Faculty 617-353-2000.  Usernames are any "socially
	acceptable" 8-character name.
        Unix accounts: Mail or finger user@bu.edu or first.last@bu.edu.  
        Mailing user@bu.edu is currently broken but should be fixed soon.

        CS: cs.bu.edu
	Undergrad CS: csa.bu.edu.
	Engineering: buenga.bu.edu (faculty/admin)
	
	In the fall (of 1992) BU will set up a nameserver on bu.edu.

Bowdoin:					Changed: Mon Feb 15 1993
	Studnets: fl*@polar.bowdoin.edu, where f is the first initial, l* is
	  the lastname up to 7 characters.
	Administrative staff: @henry.bowdoin.edu.  Mailboxes are fl* as above,
	  or last_first
	Faculty: either of the above depending on personal preference.

Bradley University:
	Faculty: bradley.bradley.edu
	Students: buhub.bradley.edu, camelot.bradley.edu.  Usernames are
	  chosen by the user and may be from three to eight characters long. 
	Heartland Freenet: heartland.bradley.edu  Free use to the public, used
	  mostly by the Peoria public. Use login 'bbguest'. login names are
	  usually flllllll or fmllllll.
	Chemistry: chem1.bradley.edu
	CS: bucs1.bradley.edu, cssun1, cssun2
	Physics: truth.bradley.edu
	Physics: beauty.bradley.edu

Brandeis:
	Undergraduates: pip.cc.brandeis.edu
		Usernames on pip are of the form STXXYYYY where XX is
		the year the student entered Brandeis and YYYY is the
		student's campus mailbox number. Not all students use
		their accounts, so check with the student before emailing.
		US mail can be sent to 
			<Student Name>
			MB <YYYY>, Brandeis University
			PO Box 9110
			Waltham, MA 02254-9110

	For phone information: On-campus students can be reached by dialing an
	automated "spell-the-name" server at +1 617 736 3000 , 24 hours a day,
	or during business hours through the Brandeis operator at +1 617 736
	2000.  Off-campus students' numbers can be obtained through the campus
	information booth at +1 617 736 4770 during business hours.

	Some undergrads have accounts on a more advanced unix machine,
	chaos.cs.brandeis.edu.  Userids are chosen by the student; finger
	{lastname}@chaos.cs.brandeis.edu or mail to
	postmaster@chaos.cs.brandeis.edu for info.

	Graduate Students: binah.cc.brandeis.edu (brandeis.bitnet).
	Not all use them; write to postmaster@binah.cc.brandeis.edu
	for information. Userid is chosen by the student.  A few
	undergrads have binah accounts.  

	DIRECTIONS to Brandeis can be had 24 hours at +1 617 736 4660.

Brown:
        You can send mail to Firstname_Lastname@Brown.Edu if the user
  	uses email and it will forward the mail to him or her. To find
	out whether the user has an email address, finger their name
	at brown.edu. This will return their preferred phone number,
	address, and email address if they use it.
        
	You can also try looking for undergrads on: brownvm.brown.edu
	(brownvm.bitnet) Username is some random alphanumerics.	
	CS: cs.brown.edu (userids are usually initials)

Bryn Mawr College:
	F_LLLLLLLLLL@cc.brynmawr.edu (F_LLLLLLLLLL@BRYNMAWR.BITNET)
	The former is fingerable, unlike the .bitnet address. This
	machine is mostly used by undergrads.

Bucknell University:
	general: username@bucknell.edu
	cs: username@pollux.bucknell.edu
	usernames are typically last names, but if the last name is
	4 letters or shorter, the first and middle initials are
	tacked onto the front.

	First initials are frequently used in usernames.  The
	first user with any given last name who gets an account gets just
	his last name as the username.  Every subsequent person with that name
	gets a first initial and then middle initials are used.

	Example:
			username	person
			--------	------
			murray		Betty Murray, switchboard operator
			dmurray		David Murray, senior
			jmurray		Jeff Murray, senior
			jemurray	Jonathan Murray, freshman


California Inst. of Tech:
	CCO MACHINES (undergrad/grad/general) CCO means campus computing org.
	  Unix:
	    tybalt.caltech.edu: also called tybalt.cco.caltech.edu or
 	    truebalt. There are about 15 machines on this cluster of
  	    Suns/NeXTs. The mail server is actually called
 	    cobalt.caltech.edu or cobalt.cco.caltech.edu (either one
	    works).  All of these are equally good. 
	  VMS: Juliet.caltech.edu.  Also romeo,hamlet,iago,portia.
	    These are all the same vax cluster. 

	Undergrad Computer Science (also used by a lot of people who don't fit
	  this discription. a fairly well used cluster. HP Bobcats
	  running Unix). 
	    through.ugcs.caltech.edu (aka through.caltech.edu) is the server.
	    Also, with the same endings: within, above, from, toward,
	    around, beyond, over, betwixt, inside, near, besides,
	    beneath, opposite, behind, amongst, atop, astride,
	    against....., vex,heckle,irk,harry,grate,bullyrag,plague,torment, 
	    molest, and badger (the irc server).

	CS department (grad/undergrad/fac...not that well used).
	  csvax.cs.caltech.edu (runs unix).

California Polytechnic State Univ./San Luis Obispo (Cal Poly, SLO):
	polyslo.CalPoly.edu

California State University/Chico: 	csuchico.edu
California State University/Sacramento: csus.edu

Calvin College: calvin.edu
	Use 'finger name@calvin.edu' (eg firstname or lastname) to find
	  addresses, since userids include parts of student numbers, so are
	  hard to guess.
	Students:  flllllnn (first intitial, first 5 of last name,
	  last 2 digits of student number; except lastnames starting with
	  Dutch prefixes Van Vander Vande etc., where just the v and first 4
	  letters of second part of lastname.  Thus Henk Vander Bos, #123456,
	  becomes hvbos56, Al Shoemaker, #987654, becomes ashoem54)
	(formerly s0###### where ###### is the student id number)
	Faculty/staff:	xxxx@calvin.edu where "xxxx" is the standard
                        faculty abbrevation, often lastname

Carnegie Mellon University:
	Undergrad: andrew.cmu.edu
	Grad CS: cs.cmu.edu
	Grad Robotics: ri.cmu.edu
	ECE: ece.cmu.edu
	Mail sent to Fname.MI.Lname@andrew.cmu.edu works, even if the name
	is slightly misspelled. Andrew usernames are two initials followed
	by two random characters. Mail to CS/RI may be sent to
	Fname.Lname@cs.cmu.edu.	CS/RI usernames are arbitrary names selected
	by the user. If you wish to send to the username, add a + at
	the end of the name: mkant+@cs.cmu.edu
	bitnet.cc.cmu.edu (carnegie.bitnet) is the gateway to bitnet.
	
	The CMU.EDU domain name has now been enabled for use of the new
	campus-wide mail/finger service.

Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland:		Changed: Tue Feb 23 1993
	Use 'whois -h whois.cwru.edu' to find usernames.  It supports
	  substring and soundex searches.
	po.cwru.edu is the post office. Every student, professor, and staff
	  member has access to email through this machine, as do alumni who
	  activated their accounts while students. (Not everybody activates
	  their account, however.) User ids are of the form fml##, where ## is
	  a number, probably less than 30. The number is omitted if equal to
	  1. If there's no middle initial, m is an 'x'.
	skybridge.scl.cwru.edu is the server for the undergraduate Unix lab.
	  The user ids on that machine are the full last name, for the most
	  part. (Mainly Computer Engineering and EE's on this machine.)

Catholic University of America
	username@cua.edu (Internet)
	username@cua.bitnet (BITNet)
	All usernames are limited to 12 characters.  For students, names are 2
	digits followed by lastname.  For faculty and staff, usernames are the
	last name, occasionally with the first initial tacked on at the end.

City University of New York (CUNY):
	cunyvm.bitnet
	Userids:
 		Students:  A99SC
 		Faculty:  AAASC
 		Liasons: LIASC
 
 	Where A is any letter from A to Z
 	Where 9 is any number from 1 to 9
 	And SC is the initals for the college within City University.
 
 	For example:    HC - Hunter College
 			QC - Queens College
		 	BC - Brooklyn College
		 	SI - College of Staten Island
		 	LG - Laguardia Community College
		 	BB - Bernard Baruch College.
		 	YC - York College


Claremont McKenna College, Claremont, CA:
	flast@cmcvx1.claremont.edu	(VAX-VMS)

Clark College:
 	firstname.lastname@clark.edu, or userid@clark.edu.  Send
	mail to postmaster@clark.edu if you have difficulty.
	Note: this is not Clark University (clarku.edu). 

Clark University:
	vax.clarku.edu and black.clarku.edu

Clarkson University:
     craft.camp.clarkson.edu    _ALL_ students are given an account
				on this machine.
     sun.soe.clarkson.edu       School of Engineering Sun server. A lot
				of students doing research have accounts
				on this machine.
     clvm.clarkson.edu          Administrative computer. Fairly isolated.
				Profs. and Admin. have accounts on this
				computer for things like class lists.
				(I'm not sure how much use this is because
				it seems that all you can do is find out
				if someone is logged in or not.)

     craft.camp and sun.soe are very usefull for finding students and
     many faculty also have accounts on these machines.

Clemson University:
	clemson.clemson.edu (VMS)
	Engineering: eng.clemson.edu

Cleveland State University:			Changed: Mon Feb 15 1993
	CIS faculty may be reached at lastname@cis.csuohio.edu.

	Engineering students with an account on the vax cluster may be reached
	at the following address: xxx9999@csvaxd.csuohio.edu, where xxx is the
	first three letters of their last name and 9999 is the last four
	digits of their social security number.

	A possible person to ask for help might be Linda Herrington at
	linda@csvaxd.csuohio.edu.

Colby:
	f_m_lastname@colby.edu
	You can figure username, firstname, or lastname.

College of William & Mary (Williamsburg, VA):
	fmllll@news.cc.wm.edu 

Colorado College:
	Students: F_LLLLLLLL%CCNODE@vaxf.colorado.edu
	Faculty: FLLLLLL%CCNODE@vaxf.colorado.edu.
	This does not support finger since it is not a real internet node.

Columbia:
	Undergrads, Grads: cunix{a,b,f}.cc.columbia.edu
	Columbia students [only] can get free accounts. Anybody
	affiliated with Columbia, Barnard, and Teachers College can
	pay for an account which has less limitations than the free
	ones. The best way to finger them is name@cunix.cc.columbia.edu.

	CS Grads and Faculty: cs.columbia.edu (also, some cs undergrads)

        Astrophysics people can be found at cuphyd.phys.columbia.edu

	Also try: ctr.columbia.edu. This has EE faculty and students who
	are affiliated with the Center for Telecommunications Research.

	Law School (Students): student@lawmail.law.columbia.edu
           The students e-mail name is there lastname plus the first
	   initial oftheir first name, so long as this is 8 characters
	   or less. Otherwise it is their FML initials. Duplication is 
           distinguished by appending a number, such as the graduation year.

	All faculty and staff are also located on lawmail.law.columbia.edu

	lawmail.law.columbia.edu currently does not respond to finger
	inquiries.  Any questions regarding mail addressing should be
	directed to:  postmaster@lawmail.law.columbia.edu
	General access questions can be sent to:

Cornell University (Ithaca, New York):
	Anyone associated with Cornell full-time can get a CIT account
	(CIT manages the computing facilities on campus).  Not everybody 
	does so. 
	
	As off fall 1992, undergrads are no longer given CornellA or
	Vax5 accounts as they were in the past.  Instead, incoming students
	are given "network ids", which consist of first, middle and last
	initials, plus a number.  Mail should be sent to 
	network_id@cornell.edu.  If the person's name is unique, mail can
	also be sent to firstname.lastname@cornell.edu.
	
	Email addresses can be searched by using finger on qi.cornell.edu. 
	Use variations such as  finger lastname@qi.cornell.edu    or
				finger "firstname lastname"@qi.cornell.edu.

	Many upperclassmen have not switched over to the new mail system.
	These students still use mail on cornella.cit.cornell.edu or
	vax5.cit.cornell.edu.  Usernames on these systems are randomly 
	generated 3 or 4 character IDs, which do not resemble real names.
	[Actually, they are an (unknown) hash function of the student's
	social security number.]
	
	Some upperclass students who have network ids still only check mail
	on cornella and vax5.  If they haven't set up autoforwarding, they 
	will not receive mail sent to cornell.edu.  

	Undergrads: crux1.cit.cornell.edu, crux2.cit.cornell.edu,
		    crux3.cit.cornell.edu, vax5.cit.cornell.edu, 
		    cornella.cit.cornell.edu
	
	Faculty and staff may ask to have a 3-character username of their
	choice.  Faculty are typically on cornella and staff on cornellc, but
	there are many exceptions.
	
	Faculty and administrators who use QuickMail can generally be found
	as first_last@qmrelay.mail.cornell.edu.
	
	Postmaster won't give out addresses.  Administrators do not give 
	out usernames over the phone.
				       
	Students' street addresses and phone numbers, as well as
	voluntarily-supplied email addresses (faculty and staff only), can 
	be looked up in CUINFO.  Telnet to cornellc.cit.cornell.edu, port 300,
	and type DIRECT.

	AIX/370 folks: eagle.tc.cornell.edu
	CS: cs.cornell.edu, svax.cs.cornell.edu, cornellf.tc.cornell.edu, or 
	    theory.tc.cornell.edu (supercomputing center)
	EE: ee.cornell.edu
	
	Bitnet: cornella.bitnet, crnlvax5.bitnet, cornellc.bitnet (gateway).

Dakota State University (Madison, SD):
	
	finger dsuvax.dsu.edu for electronic mail addresses for any
	member of the faculty, staff, or student body.  Addresses
	are typically the first seven characters of the person's last
	name plus the first character of the person's first name.

	Please address questions to postmaster@dsuvax.dsu.edu.

Dartmouth:
	Send mail to fname.lname@dartmouth.edu (or fname.mi.lname if
	it is a very common name). If the name is ambiguous, you might 
	want to finger fname.mi.lname@dartmouth.edu for info about
	exact mail address. Dartmouth.Edu resolves all mail through
	the Dartmouth Name Directory, which stores preferred email
	addresses for all students, faculty, and staff members.
	If the name is unique, you can even send mail to
	name@dartmouth.edu. Most undergrads have accounts on
	mac.dartmouth.edu. Students who don't use any email address 
	get the automatic default, @hinman.dartmouth.edu, which
	prints out the email and drops it into campus mail.

Drake University:
	Host acad.drake.edu.  'finger' works but unfortunately userids don't
	closely correspond to names and you can't 'finger part-of-name' to
	guess the userid.

Drew University (Madison, NJ):
	All students, faculty, and staff have accounts on drew.drew.edu
	(drew.bitnet). Whether they use them is another matter. Account
	names are usually of the form flllllll. In case of name collision,
	try fmllllll or fllllll#

Drexel University
  	General Computing Services: userid@duvm.ocs.drexel.edu
	  consultant's desk telephone 215.895.2698
  	Math and Computer Science : userid@mcs.drexel.edu
       	  where userid is of the form <prefix>fllllll; the prefix is u for
	  undergraduate, g for graduate, or t for temporary.

Duke:
	Undergrads, Grads, and many Faculty/Staff:
	  The mail server is bacchus.acpub.duke.edu. Mail to other machines
	  will get forwarded to it. For usernames, people are allowed to
	  select their own.  However, the Engineering school has taken to
	  setting up accounts for its students, grads, and ugrads, and uses
	  initials (fml) with possibly a number in case of name conflict.
	  Everyone else could have anything as their userid, though people are
	  encouraged to use their first initial and last name.
	Bitnet gateway: dukemvs.bitnet (dukemvs.ac.duke.edu)
	Math profs are probably {initials}@math.duke.edu
	Physics profs are probably {initials}@physics.duke.edu
	Other machines: cs.duke.edu, egr.duke.edu, psych.duke.edu
	Duke Law School is under the address charon.law.duke.edu, which is
	  fingerable, but student.law.duke.edu seems to be the better mailing
	  address.  Usernames can be hard to discover;
	  postmaster@faculty.law.duke.edu has volunteered to forward mail to
	  Law School faculty and staff, and suggest
	  postmaster@student.law.duke.edu might be willing to do the same for
	  students.

Earlham:
	Students, faculty, staff:    FFFFFFFL@yang.earlham.edu
	Administration:              FFFFFFFL@yin.earlham.edu
	Advanced computing students: FFFFFFFL@math.earlham.edu
	  in the case of an 8-character first name, the userid is FFFFFFFF
	  in the case of conflicts, the userid is FFFFFFLL, FFFFFLLL, etc.
	  increasingly, students are being assigned userid's in the format:
		xxyz@yang.earlham.edu, where
	  xx is the first two letters of the first name,
	   y is the middle initial,
	   z is the last name initial.
	Information can be sought via E-Mail from opr@yang.earlham.edu
	opr can get you directory info, or user info.

Florida Atlantic University				Changed: Mon Feb 15 1993
	The local ACM chapter runs cybernet.cse.fau.edu, on which everyone can
	  get accounts, and many FAU students (and some faculty) use it.

Florida State University
	A very low percentage of students and faculty outside the science
	departments have accounts of any kind.  Those that do are spread out
	on many servers with the fsu.edu domain.

	Most new non-science accounts are being created on
	garnet.acns.fsu.edu, though few students (or even faculty) are aware
	that they could get an account.

	To find a student or faculty member, two systems have been set up.
	Unfortunately, neither is working all the time and neither correctly
	locates all accounts.
	  1: email whitepages@wp.fsu.edu with the words
		whois "name"
	     in the subject line, with no message body
	  2: whois -h mailer.cc.fsu.edu "name"
	Other than these two methods, it's very difficult to track someone
	down unless you know which server they're on (there are more than 50
	of them).

Gallaudet University (for the Deaf), Washington, DC  20002
   GALLUA.GALLAUDET.EDU  a VAX/VMS machine.  Student usernames typically start
                         with 11, 12, 13 or 14, with 11 being the most common.
                         The rest of the username is first initial last name.
                         Faculty and staff are typically first initial, middle
                         initial, last name.  The node is also reachable as
                         GALLUA.BITNET.
   GALLUX.GALLAUDET.EDU  a VAX/Ultrix (UNIX) machine.  Not nearly as many users
                         on this machine.  Name conventions are the same as for
                         GALLUA.
 
Georgia Institute of Technology (Georgia Tech):		Changed: Mon Feb 15 1993
	All Users: prism.gatech.edu (aka hydra.gatech.edu)
	  Prism is a Yellow Pages/Mail domain to which all students, faculty
	  and staff have access through accounts issued by the computer
	  center. A number of users, especially faculty and graduate students
	  in Computer Science, have access to departmental resources which are
	  not part of the Prism domain. They may get their mail there, though
	  typically people use prism as their main mail drop and forward it
	  from there to their home systems.
	CS Dept (Faculty, staff, PhD students): gatech.edu, boa.gatech.edu
	user@cc.gatech.edu. (cc = College of Computing)

	Usernames:
	  students: gtXXXXy (example: gt6953b), where XXXX = last 4 digits
	    of Campus PO Box, y = A-E to make it unique (PO Boxes are shared)
	  faculty/staff: firstname.lastname@department.gatech.edu
	Also try: username@hydra.gatech.edu, 

Glassboro State College:
	
    Below is a list of computers and who uses them. For help, send mail
    to postmaster on whichever one seems the most appropriate. If you're
    not sure, send it to postmaster@saturn.glassboro.edu. For those with
    access to gopher you can find current email info on our server. It 
    includes most of the electronic mail addresses on campus.
 
 
    heroes.glassboro.edu        administrative departments
                                secretaries
                                some faculty
 
    saturn.glassboro.edu        Academic Computing
                                students

    gboro.glassboro.edu         Computer Science faculty
                                students

    Most students are accessible via <username>%saturn.dnet@glassboro.edu.  
    Student usernames are last name, with first initial added to the end if
    needed.

	Note that you cannot finger glassboro.edu at present,
	but should be able to by July or August 1991.


Grinnell College, Iowa:
	Addresses at Grinnell College are of the following format:
 
        username@nodename       e.g., POSTMASTER@GRIN1.bitnet
                                  or  POSTMASTER@GRIN2.bitnet

	Usernames are typically the first 8 letters of the person's last name,
	frequently with the first initial or first and middle added at the end
	(e.g., WILLIAMS, MILLERM, JOHNSOAS).  As a result, it would be
	difficult to guess someone's username.  The nodename is GRIN1.bitnet
	for all students and faculty; GRIN2.bitnet is for administrative
	staff.  If you do not know the address of someone at Grinnell,
	please send a message to POSTMASTER@GRIN1.bitnet asking for help.
 
	Grinnell College now has an Internet connection - ac.grin.edu.

Hampshire College (Amherst, MA):
	username@hamp.hampshire.edu, where username is of the form fllllll

Haverford:
	Students: acc.haverford.edu

Harvard:					Changed: Mon Feb 15 1993
	Finger @husc.harvard.edu to find mail destinations.
	husc{8,9,10,11}.harvard.edu are Unix machines, which is what most
	  people use for e-mail.  husc{3,4,6,7,12}.harvard.edu are VMS
	  machines, used a bit for mail, but more for application server for
	  the MAC/PC networks, etc.
	Undergrads: @husc.harvard.edu, @husc9.uucp
	Username is lastname, with a number appended in case of duplicates.
	During Summer '90, Harvard moved most undergrad and grad
	  accounts to husc9 instead of husc4.

	All Harvard Medical School students now have accounts on
	  student.med.harvard.edu.  The system is relatively new, however, and
	  the number who actually use them now appears to be small.  The
	  usernames are of the form fllllll@student.med.harvard.edu. This is a
	  distributed PC system, and users are not fingerable.
	Harvard Law School students may have accounts on
	  hulaw{1,2}.harvard.edu. These machines are fingerable, but usernames
	  must be matched exactly to be found.

Harvey Mudd, Claremont CA: 
	Undergrads: flastname@hmcvax.claremont.edu or
	    flllllll@jarthur.claremont.edu; in case of name conflicts
	    more letters of firstname are used.   hmcvax is more
	    likely for class of '94 and before; jarthur for '95 and up.
	CS faculty: lastname@jarthur.claremont.edu
	Other faculty: lastname@hmcvax.claremont.edu
	Administration: flastname@hmcadm.claremont.edu
	finger fullname@jarthur.claremont.edu usually works, but users
	    can change their fullnames to anything

Illinois Institute of Technology
	Domain IIT.EDU has servers on iitmax.iit.edu and karl.iit.edu.	So far
	no one from there has volunteered how to deduce user names.  One
	correspondent said: "try lastname@IITVAX1.BITNET@UICVM.UIC.EDU"

Illinois State University (Bloomington, Illinois)
	FMLastname@ilstu.edu.  Most students do not have internet access.
	Finger works.

Indiana University:

	Faculty, Staff, Students: username@ucs.indiana.edu
	Usernames are portions of the person's real name. 8 characters,
	usually the last name plus maybe a few initials.

	Student/Staff VAX/VMS machines: (main nodes)
		gold.ucs.indiana.edu, aqua.ucs.indiana.edu,
		jade.ucs.indiana.edu, amber.ucs.indiana.edu,
		rose.ucs.indiana.edu  

	silver.ucs.indiana.edu  -- Unix,  All students ( mostly CS undergrads)
	copper.ucs.indiana.edu  -- These two are VAXen running Ultrix
				   (UNIX) They're student machines.
	bronze.ucs.indiana.edu  -- This is  DEC RISC (Not a VAX)
				   running Ultrix. Staff only...
	iuvax.cs.indiana.edu     -- Unix,  CS students  ( mostly grad students
					and faculty )

	The email address of any student, faculty, or staff member at Indiana
	can be found out by doing a 
		"finger lastname@indiana.edu" or
		"whois -h indiana.edu lastname" or 
		"whois -h iugate.ucs.indiana.edu lastname"
	Type "finger help@indiana.edu" or "whois -h indiana.edu help" for
	more information about the service.
	
Instituto Tecnologico y de Estudios Superiores de Monterrey (ITESM):
	Students: mtecv2.mty.itesm.mx	(vax machine)
		  academ01.mty.itesm.mx (RS/6000)

		  Userids begin with BL plus the id number of the
                  student, i.e., bl205102. 

	Every student can ask for an account on the vax machine. There
	are other computing facilities as well.

Iowa State University:	fname_mi_lastname@iastate.edu

Johns Hopkins:
	Accounts are located on
		jhunix.hcf.jhu.edu
		jhuvms.hcf.jhu.edu
		jhuvm.hcf.jhu.edu
	All are on bitnet.

	The default userid is of the form lllll_fm or llllll_f. However,
	students may choose whatever userid they wish, which can be just
	about anything.

Kalamazoo College:
	fllllll@kzoo.edu

Kansas State Univ.:					Changed: Mon Feb 15 1993
	VM/XA: ksuvm.ksu.edu.  All students, faculty, and staff.  This is by
	  far the most popular machine.
	KSUVM has a homebrewed finger server that allows you to search
	  for KSU students, faculty, and staff.  Usage is 
		"finger	lastname,firstname@ksuvm.ksu.edu"
	  This does a fuzzy lookup so you don't have to get the spelling exact
	  and returns the KSUVM userid (if any) plus name, address, phone
	  number, major (if student), and classification.  If you know the
	  KSUVM userid you can look that up with
		"finger userid-xxx@ksuvm.ksu.edu"
	  (where "xxx" is the userid you want to find). 
	Unix:
	  matt.ksu.ksu.edu      All students, faculty, and staff.
	  depot.cis.ksu.edu	CS faculty, staff, and grads.
	  cygnus.cis.ksu.edu	CS undergrads.
	  eece.ksu.edu          EE grads and faculty.
	  math.ksu.edu          Math staff, faculty, grads, and some undergrads.

Kenyon College: 
	username@kenyon.edu
	Username is usually the last name, sometimes with initials
	tacked onto the end. 

LaSalle University (Philadelphia, Pennsylvania)
	Host hp800.lasalle.edu
	Faculty, Staff, and student staff: use last name, eg. jones (llllllll)
	Course accounts: xnnn0mmm or xnnnamm, where x is 1-letter course name
	  (e.g. c for computer science), nnn is 3 digit course id, 0 or a is
	  entered exactly as shown, and mmm or mm is the student's individual
	  number within the course)
	Incoming finger (from the Internet) does not yet work.

Lehigh University:
	Undergrads: username@lehigh.edu (ns1.cc.lehigh.edu)
	Help with specific userids can be obtained from
	lucc@ns1.cc.lehigh.edu.

	Lehigh has installed "white pages" server on lehigh.edu.
	Fingering for a person's first or last name (case insensitive)
	at lehigh.edu will return all relavant user info (email
	address, full name etc.) 

Lenoir-Rhyne College (Hickory, NC 28603):
	E-mail address is username@alice.lrc.edu or Username@mike.lrc.edu.


Louisiana State University (Baton Rouge):
	CS: csvax.csc.lsu.edu
	EE: max.ee.lsu.edu
	SNCC (S/m Network Comp Center): lsu500.sncc.lsu.edu

Macalester College (Saint Paul):

	Every student and faculty member has an account on the college's VAX
	system.  Many students have additional accounts on departmental
	machines.  These instructions are for finding someone on the VAX.
	Finger userid@macalstr.edu, where userid is of the form
	flllllll for students, and lname for faculty. Numbers are added
	to the end of the userid in case of name conflicts.


McGill University:

     Computer Science profs, grads, and ugrads have mail forwarded from
     login_name@cs.mcgill.ca to the correct machine.  Currently all
     profs have their accounts on opus.cs.mcgill.ca, and grads and
     undergraduates have accounts on binkley.cs.mcgill.ca.


Memphis State University:
	Undergrads: memstvx1.memst.edu (memstvx1.bitnet)
	   memstvx1 is a VAX connected to both internet and bitnet,
	       and also serves as the domain name server for memst.edu
	       While it does support Finger, it only reports users
	       currently logged on.
	   All instructional account usernames are dependent on the
	       course title  (e.g. MATH1234567 would be an account
	       for a Math class)
	   Grads and Staff accounts are usually First_InitialLastname
	       e.g. JSMITH for John Smith (but there are exceptions)

	Some departments have their own machines, but the majority of
	accounts are on the VAX.

Merrimack College: (inquiries to postmaster@merrimack.edu welcome)
	Faculty: except in extraordinary circumstances lastname@merrimack.edu
	Undergrads: Aliases exist for most students as
	First.MI.Last@merrimack.edu
	REAL ids are usually lastnamefirstinitial@merrimack.edu with dups
	getting lastfirstinitmiddleinit@merrimack.edu
	For example:
	Jane A. Smith	-> jane.a.smith and smithj@merrimack.edu
	Joe L. Smith    -> joe.l.smith and smithjl@merrimack.edu

Millsaps College:
        All faculty, staff, and students are userid@okra01.millsaps.edu.
        Userid is produced from first five letters of last name, first two
        initials - merged without spaces.  In case of no middle initial, 
        nothing is used.  In case of name conflicts, numbers are added to 
        the end to produce unique userid's.

Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT):
	Finger name@mit.edu for info about the person and mail
	address. This is the same info that's used to create the
	MIT phonebook, so it is as accurate. (One can finger
	help@mit.edu for instructions in using this service.)

	All students and faculty may get an account from Project
	Athena. Their mail address will be @athena.mit.edu, even
	though athena is a distributed workstation environment.

	Finger @ai.mit.edu for AI graduate students, faculty, and
	some undergrads. Also try @media-lab.mit.edu 
	(= media-lab.media.mit.edu) for the MIT Media Lab.
	Try @lcs.mit.edu for Laboratory of Computer Science faculty, staff,
	and students.

	Also, MIT math professors can be found on math.mit.edu (a.k.a.
	bourbaki.mit.edu; however, this information is already accessible
	from fingering mit.edu information.

	MITVMA.MIT.EDU is the gateway to bitnet.

Michigan State Univ.:
	@frith.egr.msu.edu @eecae.ee.msu.edu, @kira.ee.msu.edu
	@cpsin.cps.msu.edu @cpsvax.cps.msu.edu  
	All college of Engineering students and faculty (includes CPS
	students) that have requested an account will have the address:
		user@egr.msu.edu (user@msuegr.bitnet)
	where "user" is usually the last name, but is often some other
	combination of first name, initials, etc to provide uniqueness
	throughout the college.

	In Addition, CPS students and faculty can receive mail at
		user@cps.msu.edu
	with the rules for "user" being the same as above.  As far as I know,
	the same user-id is used on both "egr.msu.edu" and "cps.msu.edu".

	General EMAIL accounts are available on Computer Center machines,
	usually the IBM3090.
	   user@ibm.cl.msu.edu user@msu.bitnet
	and also the Convex
	   user@convex.cl.msu.edu
	I don't know what the rules are for determining user IDs for Computer
	Center machines.

	MSU Information is (517) 355-1855.


Michigan Technological University:
	mtus5.cts.mtu.edu or mtus5.bitnet
        most students have accounts with the format FMLASTNA
        First initial-Middle initial-LASTNAMe  (8 letters total)
	finger does not work on these machines.

Minnesota State University System:
	Faculty (all campuses): userid@msus1.bitnet
	Faculty/Students (Mankato State Univ.): userid@vax1.mankato.msus.edu

Mississippi State univ.  Mail in the form fml#@ra.msstate.edu or
            fml#@isis.msstate.edu..  The Number will normally range
            1 and 4, it stands for the student number (First one with
            given set of initials to apply for internet access)

Mount Holyoke College:
	"mhc." may be omitted:
		a.  flllllll@mhc.mtholyoke.edu
		b.  fmllllll@mhc.mtholyoke.edu
		c.  llllllll@mhc.mtholyoke.edu

Mount Royal:
	mtroyal.ab.ca
	Student's userids are of the form llllll#### where # are the
	first four digits of the student id. Staff userids are of the
	form flastname.

Entries beginning with N may be found in the next posting
(file .../college-email/faq2.text via anonymous FTP).

	CS PhD Studs: user@newark.njit.edu
	Grad Studs:   user@hertz.njit.edu (ultrix), user@tesla.njit.edu (vms)

New Mexico Institute Of Mining And Technology:
	Try finger name@nmt.edu or finger name@jupiter.nmt.edu.  Jupiter is
	the main server;  CS students generally have accounts on
	minos.nmt.edu.  Accounts generally seem to be of the form FLLLLLLL.

New Mexico State Univ.:
	Virtually all email addresses are of the form fllllll@nmsu.edu. Finger
	is not well supported. Mail to postmaster should help. (Also, if you
	have an account, there is a postmaster program.)

New York University (NYU)
	Addresses for students at NYU are fml####@acfcluster.nyu.edu, where f,
	m, l are first, middle, last initials and #### are the last four
	digits of the social security number.  All students and staff can get
	limited mail accounts by requesting them.  Some users have nicknames:
	lastname, or lllllf, or lllllff.

North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC:
	Whois server on gyro.cc.ncsu.edu also accepts requests via finger
	All whois entries have Snail addresses, some have e-mail.

North Dakota Network
	This section describes how to find email addresses for students who
	attend Public Colleges and Universities in North Dakota.

	ND HECN PLAINS  (@plains.bitnet) -or- (@plains.nodak.edu)
	This is a Unix system.  All userids are given out according to last
	name or possibly a first initial added in front.  You are able to
	finger these accounts.

	ND HECN CMS  (@ndsuvm1.bitnet) -or- (@vm1.nodak.edu)
	This is a VM/SP (CMS) system. Userids are a bit more complicated here...
	The ND HECN (No-Dak Higher Education Computer Network) consists of the
	following schools..  Their 2-letter school code follows.
	   Bismarck State College (BJ)      North Dakota State University (NU)
	   University of North Dakota (UD)  Dickinson State College (DS)
	   Williston State College (WS)     Bottineau State College (BT)
	   Lake Region Community College (LR)  Valley City State College (VC)
	   Mayville State College (MV)      Minot State College (MN)
	   State School of Science (SS)
	Userids given out prior to (approximately) August 1991 are assigned a
	userid according to the following:  Userids are in the form of
	LL######.  LL is the "School Code" (see above).  The #'s are the first
	6 digits of the user's NAID number.

	Userids given out after August 1991 are assigned according to last
	name, or with part of their first name in front if the account is
	already taken.  They are trying to give you the same userid as your
	plain's id (if you have one). Also, people with the 'old id' can
	request to have their account renamed to the new format.  You are able
	to finger accounts on ndsuvm1, but as of 02-26-92 student names are
	not yet available to finger. (It will tell you if the account at least
	exists tho).  Faculty/Staff names are available to finger.  Each
	college has an 'administrative' account with the form LL0ADMIN.  (LL =
	School Code).  I don't know if they will give out userids, but it's
	worth a try.

	UND School of Medicine: try First.Last@medicine.und.nodak.edu for
	staff and faculty;  no student accounts as of Fall 1992.  For help
	finding someone, try 'finger' or contact
	postmaster@medicine.und.nodak.edu

Northeastern:
	The engineering postmaster is postmaster@nueng.coe.northeastern.edu.
	For other mail, try postmaster@northeastern.edu

Northern Arizona University (Flagstaff, Arizona, USA)
	You can use any of the following ways to locate people at Northern
	Arizona University.  If one doesn't work, try the next.  NOTE: not
	everyone at NAU has an electronic mailbox.
	1. finger PERSON@info.nau.edu
	   where PERSON is any part of a person's name that you know.  You may
	   have to use quotes, as in: finger "Jane Doe"@info.nau.edu. This is a
	   "white pages" style database.  For more help on this system: finger
	   @info.nau.edu
	2. mail FIRSTNAME.LASTNAME@nau.edu
	   where FIRSTNAME and LASTNAME are the person you're trying to reach.
	   You may need to specify FIRSTNAME.MIDDLEINITIAL.LASTNAME
	3. send mail to the site postmaster:  mail postmaster@nau.edu
	   Some subdomains have postmasters e.g. postmaster@cse.nau.edu for
	   the Computer Science and Engineering department.  

Northwestern:					Changed: Tue Feb 23 1993
	General e-mail services are shared by casbah.acns.nwu.edu
	  (129.105.113.52) and merle.acns.nwu.edu (129.105.113.57).  Merle is
	  in full production as of the beginning of 1993, although there are
	  not yet that many accounts on it.  This will change.  Both Casbah
	  and Merle support finger requests.
	If you have access to a PH electronic database client, you can use
	  ns.nwu.edu for a ph-nameserver.  Users must personally register an
	  e-mail address in this database for a query to provide one -- it is
	  not done automatically.  If you do not have access to a PH client,
	  the default PH-based address is <alias@nwu.edu> where the default
	  alias is f-lastname (first initial-last name).  Many people choose
	  to remove the hyphen or replace the default alias with their
	  initials, or just about anything else.  The default is a good thing
	  to try, because if it fails for any reason, PH responds with fairly
	  complete information, in plain english, including other possible
	  aliases, if there is a conflict.

NCSU:
	Faculty/Staff: accounts on adm.csc.ncsu.edu. No specific naming
	convention for faculty accounts.

	Graduate Students: accounts on druid.csc.ncsu.edu. login names are 
	gr-xxx where xxx are the initials of the person. However, using the
	person first or last name will also work. 

	All engineers have accounts on eos.ncsu.edu

	Most undergraduate id's are fmllllll@eos.ncsu.edu

Oberlin:
	Many students and faculty have accounts on ocvax{a,b}, which
	can be reached as oberlin.bitnet and ocvaxa.cc.oberlin.edu.
	Student User IDs are of the form:  S+first & last initials
	+ last 4 digits of the student ID (e.g. SDG1234)
	Faculty IDs are of the form: F + lastname. 
	Best bet is to send mail to postmaster@oberlin.bitnet

	CS students/faculty: occs.cs.oberlin.edu (student usernames
	are mostly last names, occasionally with a first initial to
	disambiguate; faculty and staff are generally 3 initials).
	You can also send mail to postmaster.

Ohio State University: 
	Faculty, Staff, Graduate students: flllllll@magnus.acs.ohio-state.edu
	CS Students, Faculty and Staff: cis.ohio-state.edu, with
	username lastname, fllllll, llllll-f, fml, firstname or lllll-fm.
	Faculty and staff are mostly first or last name.

	Also, some students have their accounts aliased so that
	you can send mail/finger to lastname.#@osu.edu
	where # is required and is anything from 1 on up to infinity
	(these numbers can get very large for names like Smith, i.e. in
	the thousands). "whois -h osu.edu" and telneting to osu.edu should
        also work.

Penn State Univ.:					Changed: Tue Feb 23 1993
	Domain: psu.edu
	The Electronic Bulletin Board contains, among many other things, the
	  entire student, staff, and faculty directory.  To use EBB, connect
	  to psuvm.psu.edu from an Internet-connected site using tn3270 (You
	  can also telnet to cac3270.psu.edu if you do not have a 3270
	  emulator, but will have to supply a terminal type).  After the
	  initial logon screen appears, type the RETURN key and the screen
	  will clear.  Type "ebb" and hit RETURN, and you will get the
	  top-level EBB menu, one item of which is "DIRECTORY".  Typing "dir"
	  and RETURN will select the university directory.  The rest should be
	  obvious, but for a couple of other points: EBB assumes you're using
	  an IBM terminal, and displays help in the form of PF keys to move
	  around, etc.  A simple "+" serves to scroll ahead, and "-" moves
	  backward. Typing the RETURN key alone will back up one level of
	  menus, so typing RETURN repeatedly will ultimately close the
	  connection.

Pomona College (Claremont, CA):
	Internet: fllllll@pomona.claremont.edu (bitnet flllll@pomona.bitnet)

        Usernames are the first character of the first name, followed
	by the full last name (John Doe would be JDOE).  In case of conflicts, 
	the middle initial is used between first and last name. (If JDOE 
	already has an account, James A. Doe would be JADOE).  Finger works.

Portland State University (Portland, Oregon): 
	Students: odin.cc.pdx.edu

Princeton:
	Undergrads: phoenix.princeton.edu, pucc.princeton.edu (VM)
	pucc.bitnet. (Both phoenix and pucc are now fingerable.)
	CS Grad Studs/Faculty: cs.princeton.edu
	CogSci Lab: clarity.princeton.edu
	Math Dept: math.princeton.edu

	You can also try fingering at princeton.edu.

	Some people also have accounts on gauguin.princeton.edu 

	Usernames are usually FMLLLLLL.

Purdue:
	At Purdue, engineering students (undergrad/grad) have accounts
	on machines on the Engineering Computer Network (ECN).  There
	are hundreds of machines, but the main ones are named according
	to a fairly discernible system, i.e.

	e?.ecn.purdue.edu = Electrical	c?.ecn.purdue.edu = Civil
	k?.ecn.purdue.edu = Chemical	g?.ecn.purdue.edu = Nuclear/Aero
	m?.ecn.purdue.edu = Mechanical	p?.ecn.purdue.edu = Potter Library

	In each case, "?" is one of 'a', 'b', 'c', etc..check your
	local host tables or nameserver for a current list.
	Undergrads usually end up on the 'n' series of machines... en,
	mn, cn, and gn.

	Effective 10/16/90, mail to ecn hosts need only be labeled
	with the local domain. For example, user@ecn.purdue.edu. Mail
	sent there will automatically be forwarded to the users mailbox.

	Usernames on ecn machines are assigned according to user
	preferences. Try the usual (initials, fllllll, first name,
	last name, etc.). You can send mail to ecn.purdue.edu (which
	will forward it to the appropriate machine). Also, if your
	finger supports arguments, doing a 'finger -l lastname' will
	find people by name regardless of account.

        Other students (CS, math/stat, and science majors) usually have
        accounts on machines operated by the Purdue University Computing
        Center (PUCC).  These machines are all in the ".cc.purdue.edu"
        subdomain.  Many usernames are based on the user's last name and
        initials, but many still use three letter/number combinations which
        have nothing to do with the user's name.  Computing center staff
        usernames are either a name chosen by the user, or a three-letter
        combination beginning with "a".  Additionally, "finger" with a
        name argument will find all people with that name, so try
        "finger -l lastname".

	Students are found on the 'instructional' machines; the
	distribution of major courses is approximately like this:

	expert  = low-level courses for non CS or EE majors, some CS courses
	sage    = more low-level courses, first semester CS
	feserve = freshman engineering courses and some CS courses
	sonata  = some Math and CS courses
	mentor  = most other CS courses

	Students not in one of these courses may still have an account on
	one of these machines, since there are many smaller groups to 
	which accounts are issued.  Also, any Purdue student may obtain
	a student personal account on one of these machines.

	Research users are found scattered around all the PUCC
	machines, but mace, boiler, and j are the most likely places
	to find them. Staff can always be reached through 'staff'
	regardless of where they have their accounts.

	In addition to those, there is an IBM mainframe which is found
	on the Internet as vm.cc.purdue.edu or on BITNET as PURCCVM.
	It is used primarily by research users and Computer Technology
	majors.  Some student personal accounts are also on this machine
	Usernames are either based on the person's real name or Xyyy 
	where yyy is a 3-character PUCC ID.

	Graduate CS students are found on machines in the ".cs.purdue.edu"
	subdomain, including "arthur", "mordred", "merlin", and other
	machines named after characters from the Arthurian legends.
	Mail to cs.purdue.edu usually works.

	Veterinary students are found on machines in the ".vet.purdue.edu"
	subdomain; these machines are named after animals or other vet
	terms e.g. "dog", "goat", "pharm"...Agricultural/Agronomy Engineering
	students are found on machines in the ".acn.purdue.edu" subdomain;
	these include "harvest", "barn", etc...Some folks in chemistry
	can be found on machines in the ".chem.purdue.edu" subdomain;
	many of these are named after items from the Dr. Who series,
	e.g. "doctor", "tardis", "k9"...Some folks in psychology can be
	found on machines in the ".psych.purdue.edu" subdomain; these
	machines are named after Latin/South American countries,
	e.g. "peru", "brazil", "mexico", "panama"...Some folks in
	biology can be found on machines in the ".bio.purdue.edu" subdomain;
	some of these machines are named after Tolkien characters,
	e.g. "bilbo", "gollum"...Some folks in physics can be found on
	machines in the ".physics.purdue.edu" subdomain; these machines
	are named after physicists, e.g. "maxwell", "newton"... The
	Krannert School of Management is in the .mgmt subdomain, with
	hosts zeus and hera. Most management students will be found on
	a PUCC machine.

Queen's University, Kingston, Ontario, Canada
	Faculty and staff: firstname.initial.lastname@queensu.ca.
	  Unfortunately you have to spell the name exactly as in the Personnel
	  records.  This is an IBM mainframe machine with no Finger server.
	Computing and Information Science: finger x@qucis.queensu.ca, where x
	  is lastname or firstname.

Reed College:
	username@reed.edu, where username is of the form flllllll

Rice:
	Mail may be sent to <username>@rice.edu.  You can't finger this
	  machine. Rice students now have off-campus electronic access (email,
	  netnews), so long as it is for educational purposes only.
	Owlnet accounts are provided for undergraduate and graduate engineers.
	  Non-engineers are given accounts when needed for a class, and then the
	  accounts are deleted after the class is over. A general address for
	  these accounts is @owlnet.rice.edu.
	All students are given accounts on the rice mainframe computer, though
	  off-campus access is still restricted for these accounts unless given
	  permission.  The address is @ricevm1.rice.edu and userid's are of the
	  form fllll00, so John Smith is JSMIT00@ricevm1.rice.edu.
	Here's a small list of machines to try when searching for a user.
	  Department machines are generally for MS/PhD graduate students,
	  faculty, and staff. The OWLNET machines are used for classes. (Thus
	  the user population on OWLNET machines consists primarily of
	  undergraduates and graduate students in professional degree plans such
	  as Master of Computer Science.)
	All the names given should have ".rice.edu" appended to them.

	Stanford has implemented a finger service for its whois database.  Try
	"finger name@stanford.edu" first -- most students and lots of staff
	and faculty now have their e-mail addresses registered with this
	service.  Name can be lastname, or for better results flllll or
	fmllllll.

	Alternatively, this service can be accessed via whois:

	whois -h stanford.edu name

	If that doesn't work, most students (and lots of staff and faculty)
	have accounts on leland.stanford.edu.  The finger daemon on leland
	was turned off by December 1992;  try its various clients: elaine0
	through elaine53(.stanford.edu)

	A couple of other machines to try:

	CS (Grad and undergrad): xenon.stanford.edu
	Geology/Earth sciences: pangea.stanford.edu
	EE: sierra.stanford.edu

St. Olaf College (Northfield, MN):

     UNIX accounts are created for all students upon their admission to the
     College.  Not all faculty and staff have accounts yet, but we're
     working on that.

	General address form:	lname@stolaf.edu
	Last name conflicts are usually resolved by adding first
	and/or middle initials to the end of the last name.

	Try fingering Lname@stolaf.edu (note the capital letter).

	Try using the St. Olaf Gopher information server at gopher.stolaf.edu.
	Phonebook information can be found under "St. Olaf Information".

	Try sending email to postmaster@stolaf.edu describing the
	person you're trying to contact.

	CSO phone book server at cso.stolaf.edu.

SUNY/Alfred (Alfred, NY)
	(SUNY College of Technology at Alfred)
	Students and faculty: llllllfm@snyalfva.cc.alfredtech.edu
	   (lastname, firstname, middlename, though middle name sometimes
	    isn't used.

SUNY/Binghamton: (Binghamton, NY)

	In order to contact someone at SUNY-Binghamton you'll have to
	give them a call; there is no way of figuring out a student's
	address given their name, as the mapping is random (sequential
	in the order people apply for accounts).

	Undergrads: bXNNNNN@HOSTNAME.cc.binghamton.edu where X is a
		letter depending on what year they got their account:
		91/92: A 92/93: B(?); NNNNN are random digits, almost
		always starting with 0; HOSTNAME is either bingvaxa
		(VMS), bingvaxu (Unix), bingsuns (SunOS), bingvmb
		(IBM), or bingtjw (IBM).  Older userids are of the
		form vyNNNN@bingvaxa, vuNNNN@bingvaxu, and
		bgNNNN@bingvmb.

	Interested undergrads tend to have accounts on bingvaxa,
	though those in Math/CS classes will have accounts on
	bingsuns.  

	An e-mail directory for some faculty and staff is available;
	telnet to bingvmb.cc.binghamton.edu
	DIAL VTAM
	ELIXIR
	Choose from menu.

SUNY/Buffalo:
	Grads, Undergrads: username@ubvms.cc.buffalo.edu [finger not possible]
		Userids of the form VNNNXXXX where NNN are the first
		3 digits of one's social security number, and XXXX are
		4 alphanumerics representing the rest of the social
		security number. 
	General Computing Center (students): username@acsu.buffalo.edu

	ubvms is a VAX, and most students had accounts there.
	Recently, however, more people are getting accounts on acsu,
	the Unix system.	

	Engineering Students: username@eng.buffalo.edu
	EE Students: username@beatrix.eng.buffalo.edu
	CS Dept: username@cs.buffalo.edu (username@sunybcs.bitnet)
	
	The usernames for the acsu, cs (and possibly eng) seems to be formed
	by something appoximating the following rules: 
	  1) If lastname is <=8 character, 
		  1.1) if it does not already exist as a username, 
			  then username=lastname. (eg. smith)
		  1.2) else 
			  username is first initial + lastname (eg. jsmith)
	  2) If lastname is too long, and a middle initial exists, 
		  then username is initials (eg. jcs)
	  3) If lastname is too long but no middle initial exists, 
		  then username is the first 5 chars of the last name, a -, and
		  then the initial. (eg. James Smithenson would be smith-j).

	The cs and acsu domains share mail alias files, so mail to a username
	at either cs.buffalo.edu or acsu.buffalo.edu will arrive at the user
	in the same mailbox.

	There are also geog (Geography), arch (Architecture) and med
	(Medicine) domains.

SUNY/Canton
	students: llllllll@scanva.bitnet, also try @snycanva.bitnet

SUNY/Geneseo
	students: fmlyy@geneseo.bitnet .. yy is graduation year
	I dont know about faculty, it might be on @snygenva.bitnet.

SUNY/Potsdam
	students: llllllss@snypotvb.bitnet .. where ss are last 2 digits of SS#
	faculty: llllllfm@snypotva.bitnet

SUNY/Stony Brook:
	Undergraduates: flllllll@ccvm.sunysb.edu (sbccvm.bitnet)
		        flllllll@ccmail.sunysb.edu (sbccmail.bitnet)
			(servers ccsinc.bitnet and ccnova.bitnet)
			flllllll@ic.sunysb.edu (servers are libserv1,
			csserv1, csserv2, eeserv1; can't finger).
	CS Folks: cs.sunysb.edu (cs is an alias to the host sbcs)
	You can also use the campus "white pages", whois -h sunysb.edu ...
	or try fingering at fllll@sunysb.edu

Syracuse Univ.:
     	CompSci Grads/Faculty: top.cis.syr.edu
      	   Many CompSci graduates and faculty have accounts on this
      	   machine; the usual username pattern is "lastname@top.cis.syr.edu"
	Some faculty and staff:
	   SUADMIN.bitnet (suadmin.syr.edu)
     	Other students and faculty:
      	    mailbox.syr.edu
            sunrise.syr.edu (VAX 8820/VMS)
            suvm.acs.syr.edu    (IBM 3090/CMS)
	suvm.acs.syr.edu and sunrise.syr.edu are run by the SU Computing
	  Services. Undergrads usually have accounts on sunrise (which is a
	  VAX VMS cluster). Both hosts are on bitnet as suvm and sunrise.
      	The pattern for all these hosts is: first-initial + middle-initial +
	  as much of the last name as possible. 

     	White-Pages: "finger name@syr.edu" will search the online catalog
	  white pages for a registered user that has his/her information public.
	  Mutliple matches produces multiple output.  "finger @syr.edu" for more
	  details.  The same information is available via a BITNET directory
	  server (NSERVE@SUVM.BITNET), through PSI's X.500 project, and through
	  whois -h syr.edu
     	Phone Book: The Syracuse Phone book has the same e-mail addresses as
	  are available in the White pages, but as it's only printed once a
	  year they are usually out of date.  Dialing (315) 443-1870 is campus
	  information;  if the userid exists in the phonebook, the people
	  there will be happy to give it out.
     	consult@mailbox.syr.edu  -- If the username exists, and that person
	  doesn't mind having it handed out, this userid will check into it
	  beforehand and reply via mail.

Swarthmore:
        All Students/Faculty/Staff: FLLLLLLN@cc.swarthmore.edu, where
	  F is the user's first initial, and LLLLLL is the first six letters
	  of their last name.  A '1' (one) is appended in most cases, though
	  for duplicates the number is incremented. To find people, send mail
	  to postmaster. You can also finger people by their last name.
        CS: Usually, lastname@cs.swarthmore.edu
	Engineering: usually lastname@engin.swarthmore.edu

	[The following is the old info, which still holds for some people:
	 All Students: xxxYY@swat.swarthmore.edu, where xxx is the
		student's initials, YY the year of graduation.
		In case of duplicates, extra "x" are added between
		the initials and year. If there are triplicates, they
		keep on adding x's. You can also use
		campus.swarthmore.edu (swarthmr.bitnet). If they have
		no middle name, use "_" instead of the middle initial.
		To find people, send mail to postmaster.
	 Faculty and staff have usernames as their last names on
	 campus.swarthmore.edu.]

Texas A&M University:

	All students can have an account on a VAX cluster, a heterogeneous
	set of UNIX boxes, or a VM/CMS machine. Probably less than
	30% of the student body (40K students) takes advantage of this. The
	format of the usernames is FML#### where fml are the initials and ####
	is the last four digits of the SSN.  If a student has no middle
	initial then '0' (Zero) is used.  These domain is "tamu.edu" and the
	machine could be any of several choices like venus, rigel, summa,
	sigma, etc.
		General Unix: 		tamuts.tamu.edu, tamaix.tamu.edu,
					tamsun.tamu.edu
		General VAX/VMS: 	zeus.tamu.edu, venus.tamu.edu, 
					summa.tamu.edu, sigma.tamu.edu,
					rigel.tamu.edu
                General VM/CMS:         tamvm1.tamu.edu

	Finding addresses:
		Try fingering lastname@tamsun.tamu.edu or lastname@tamu.edu.
		(tamu.edu uses ph, the CSO Nameserver)

	The computer science department's domain is "cs.tamu.edu".  The
	statistics dept is "stat.tamu.edu".  The username format on these
	machines is usually fffffffl or flllllll.  Some old accounts may have
	first names or last names only.
	The math department's domain is math.tamu.edu.

	There are about a million other departmental machines with varying
	names but I believe they are all in the form "xxx.tamu.edu".

Trinity College (Hartford CT):
	Students, staff, and faculty: firstname.lastname@mail.trincoll.edu
	mail.trincoll.edu is currently equivalent to trincoll.edu

Tufts University:
	tufts.edu, tufts.bitnet

United States Air Force Academy
	Cadets: CDTnnnn@saturn.usafa.af.mil
	Computer science: host kirk.usafa.af.mil
	Finger works at both sites.

Univ. of Aalborg: @iesd.auc.dk

Univ. of Akron:
	
	Academic Machines: Faculty, Grad, Undergrad
		vax1.cc.uakron.edu (vax, so finger works)
		vm1.cc.uakron.edu (vms, so finger doesn't work) 
		vm1 is also known as akronvm.bitnet
	Most students and faculty have accounts on either of these machines.
	Usernames are usually r1 for faculty, r2 for graduate
	students, and r3 for undergrads, followed by first, middle,
	and last initials. (If the student doesn't have a middle
	initial it is omitted.) Naming conflicts are resolved by
	adding a digit to the end of the userid (e.g., 1, 2, ... 9).

	for example: mine is r2sk9@vax1.cc.uakron.edu...

	Engineering Machines: Grad, undergrad
		file01.ecgf.uakron.edu (unix, but no fingering)
		file02.ecgf.uakron.edu (unix, but no fingering)
	Userid's normally begin with the first two letters of the
	person's major (el = electrical, me = mechanical) followed by
	4 digits to make 6 digit userid. Undergrads are given id's of
	form bsxxxx. 

	Math Department machines: Faculty, Grad, Undergrad
		vonneuman.cs.uakron.edu (unix and fingering works)
	Only math students or students enrolled in courses offered by
	math dept have accounts. finger works with first,lastnames or
	userid's. 

	userid's for grads and faculty are by their last names.
	undergrads and class accounts begin with sun followed by three
	digits making 6 letter userid. 

	Mechanical Engineering Machines: Grad,faculty
	Any grad engineering student can have an account. 
	Finger doesn't work for these machines.
		starshine.mech.uakron.edu
		sunshine.mech.uakron.edu  
		moonshine.mech.uakron.edu 
	Userid's are first names.

	Help: postmaster@ua1vm.ua.edu

Univ. of Alaska
	Bitnet: username@alaska.bitnet  Internet: username@acadO.alaska.edu
	Usernames are of the form CTFMLN where:
	C=Campus
	    A is U of A Anchorage
	    D is for Kodiak College
	    F is for U of A Fairbanks
	    I is for Kenai Peninsula College
	    J is for U of A Southeast (in Juneau)
	    K is for U of A Southeast (Ketchikan branch)
	    P is for Mat-Su College (in Palmer)
	    T is for U of A Southeast (Sitka branch)
	    V is for Prince William Sound Community College (in Valdez)
	T is for usage type.
	    S is for an undergraduate student
	    T is for a graduate student
	    F is for faculty
	    N is for staff.
	    X is for consultants
	FML is the initials of first, middle, and last names, respectively.
	N is a number, and is only given (and then it starts from one) if
	  there are more than one person at the same school with the same
	  status and initials
	O is the computer that the person is on.
	  1 is Southeast and affiliated schools (don't know C letters for them)
	  2 is Anchorage and its affiliates (Kodiak, Kenai, Mat-Su, and Prince
	    William Sound)
	  3 is Fairbanks and affiliates
	However, a person with enough access can use other campus' computers.

Univ. of Arizona:
	Historically computer access at the UA had been limited to students,
	faculty and staff who had either a job, or a class which required a
	computer. Recently the Unix Users Group at the University of Arizona
	began providing General Access Systems for no charge to UA students.

	The machines are configured from donated, loaned and retired equipment
	and managed by volunteer effort. As a volunteer effort, there is not
	time to respond to postmaster requests for usernames so please do not
	send address requests to the postmaster. Use the finger utility
	instead; it will respond to "real name" requests (in the following
	"gas" means "gas.uug.arizona.edu"):

	finger -l kennedy@gas gotobed@gas |grep "Login name:"
	Login name: bjk       			In real life: Brian J. Kennedy
	Login name: kennedys  			In real life: Steven A Kennedy 
	Login name: jgotobed  			In real life: Joe Gotobed

	While we are attempting to support a rational username policy, it is
	not foolproof as this example shows. If the finger info returns
	nothing, the person has no account on these systems.

	Due to limited disk capacity, ( < 1Mb per account) the usage is
	limited primarily to internet news, telnet, ftp and email.  There are
	currently about 500 students and a capacity of about 3,000 accounts.
	While accounts are currently limited to students, we expect to provide
	access to the general staff & faculty sometime in the spring of 1993.

	There are nearly a hundred subdomains at the University, each with
	their own access policies, username assignments and email schemes. If
	the finger utility does not reveal the address of a friend, a phone
	call to them asking for their address is probably the most efficient
	way to discover it.

	Many faculty and staff are on ccit.arizona.edu.  If someone tells you
	they are on "cosy" or "icosy," forget it; you can't send mail to them
	(although they can send mail to you).

	Undergrads in Computer Science are on caslon.cs.arizona.edu.
	Undergrads in Engineering are on a cluster of Suns; try
	evax2.engr.arizona.edu.

	Grad students and Faculty are usually given accounts on their
	department/college systems.  Try math.arizona.edu;
	physics.arizona.edu; mis.arizona.edu; cs.arizona.edu, etc.

	In the School of Business, you can try FirstinitialLastname (e.g.
	RReagan) @bpa.arizona.edu with very good success.  If
	FirstinitialLastname is ambiguous, a username might be
	LastnameFirstinitial instead. (Main site was mis.arizona.edu until
	late 1992).  On BITNET send mail to username@arizbpa.bitnet

	Arizona.EDU is the campus mail gateway, but only those who ask get
	aliases on Arizona.EDU.  You could try last-name@Arizona.EDU if you
	suspect the person you want uses EMAIL a lot.

Univ. of Atlanta: @auc.UUCP

Univ. of British Columbia (Vancouver, BC, Canada)
	Domain ubc.ca.  Public accounts might be on unixg.ubc.ca.
	Computer Science is cs.ubc.ca

University of Calgary
        General (Students/Faculty): @acs.ucalgary.ca
	CS students/faculty: @cpsc.ucalgary.ca
	for all faculty,  staff,  grads,  undergrads
	- often last name, or first name, or initials. or last name
	followed by initials. 

Univ. of California/Berkeley: Many different accounts on many machines. 
	Undergraduates in General: ocf.berkeley.edu
	Faculty, staff, and graduate students can also get accounts on
	ocf.berkeley.edu.

	Undergrad CS/EE, 1st Year Grad: cory.berkeley.edu (This is for
	undergrad juniors and seniors and first year graduate
	students. Most other graduate students have their own
	workstations. For freshmen and sophomores, one must look for a
	class account or ocf public cluster. Undergrads now have to
	pay for accounts on cory, so fewer people will be using it.)
	First Year Graduate CS students: try cory.berkeley.edu or
	xcssun.berkeley.edu. antipodes.berkeley.edu

	CS Faculty, Grads, Staff: cs.berkeley.edu (aliases mail address)
	CS Grad Students: snake.cs.berkeley.edu
		Good systems to try are (all .cs.berkeley.edu
		or .berkeley.edu) sprite, harmony, sequoia, larch,
		robotics, postgres, and ginger.
		tenet.icsi.berkeley.edu also has some CS grad students on 
		it.  Many machines in the department are now
		foo.cs.berkeley.edu, but not all are.
	EE Faculty: esvax, ic, cad, or a workstation

	Janus will be going away soon, as will ucbarpa.  Many csgrads will
	have mail aliases on cs.berkeley.edu, which will eventually support
	finger.  Systems to try for grad students are (all .berkeley.edu):
	sprite, harmony, sequoia, yew, larch, robotics, postgres, and ginger.
	Soon, these will be moved into the cs.berkeley.edu subdomain instead
	of berkeley.edu subdomain (ie, you'd finger @sprite.cs.berkeley.edu).
	This will happen soon, but hasn't happened yet.

	Names for the above accounts are usually, but not always,
	combinations of the user's real first, middle and last names
	and/or initials. However, finger will search the "real name"
	field as well as the account name.

	There are many class accounts (which all students get). These
	are found on web.berkeley.edu,bard.berkeley.edu, and
	xcssun.berkeley.edu.  
	zooey, buddy, franny, and seymour too, except they're being
	retired. Danube, amazon, congo, po, and volga and a cluster of stars
	(named after stars) are supposed to be the replacements. 
	web and buddy hold classes that freshmen and sophomores often take.
	seymour and franny are often used for classes for business majors. 

	Class account usernames are typically cnnn-mxx or ennn-mxx, where
	'c' or 'e' denotes CS or EE, nnn is the course number, m is the
	section number (not always used), and xx are two letters.

	Statistics class accounts are of the form s#xxxx, where # is
	the class number and xxxx is some string of alphabetic characters.
	These accounts live on gandalf.berkeley.edu. Statistics
	cluster computers are named after Tolkien characters.

	qal.berkeley.edu is used for courses in "practical computer use"
	(taught by the anthropology department).  Account names are
	193xxx, where xxx is the last name of the user.

	Math (Graduate and Faculty): math.berkeley.edu 
	Stat Department: stat.berkeley.edu
	Physics Grads and Undergrads: physics.berkeley.edu
	Mech. E Profs & Grads: euler.berkeley.edu, tycho.berkeley.edu
	Public Cluster (some undergrads): ocf.berkeley.edu
	School of Education:  soe.berkeley.edu
	Other machines to try: ucbvax.berkeley.edu  

	garnet.berkeley.edu and violet.berkeley.edu are the most
	likely place for a pay-for-use account. Some departments
	maintain accounts on these machines for faculty, though,
	so these machines are the place to try for faculty affiliated
	with departments that have no real computing facilities.
	Almost anyone on campus can pay for an account on these machines.

	Some of the class accounts are also on congo. Generally
	addresses for the first semester classes are:
	CS 60A - c60a-__@danube
	CS 3 - c3-1a__@amazon or c3-1b__@congo

	postmaster@nettlesome.berkeley.edu should be considered as a last
	choice when looking from someone electronically. 

Univ. of California/Davis: 
	@ucdavis.edu -- works if you know their account name
	   userids are of the form fmlllll.
	@clover.ucdavis.edu -- works for anyone in the CS department
		whois -h ucdavis.edu <name>
	CS: First.Last@cs.ucdavis.edu
	Engineering/CS: First.Last@ee.ucdavis.edu 
			or First.Last@eecs.ucdavis.edu

Univ. of California/Irvine:
	CS Undergrads: bonnie.ics.uci.edu
	    Mail sometimes restricted; policy has changed several times.
	    Userid usually FLLLLLLL (8 char max); sometimes FFFFFFFL.
	CS Grads/Staff/Faculty: ics.uci.edu
	    Faculty userids are usually their last names, sometimes
	    initials, a few firstname only.  Grads usually FLLLLLLL,
	    some lastname only.  Staff sometimes firstname, sometimes lastname.
	Other departments: mostly grads; userids usually lastname.
	   Biology dept: sanger.bio.uci.edu
	   EE: balboa.eng.uci.edu
	   Physics dept: skid.ps.uci.edu
	   Social sciences: ss.uci.edu
	Try fingering fname-lname@XX.uci.edu (for XX=ics,sanger.bio, etc.)

	There are two types of accunts on orion.oac.uci.edu:
	(1) Staff in the Office of Academic Computing
	(2) Students
	Staff userids on orion are usually FLLLLLLL, 8 char max.  The student
	accounts on orion are different, though.  Any student can get an orion
	account, but not a lot do.  The userids for these accounts are seven
	characters as follows: first "ea", then two characters representing
        major and grad vs. undergrad status, respectively, 
	(e.g., i = information & computer science, u = undergrad),
	then three random digits.  Non-staff orion users tend to use
	their accounts infrequently because of usage limits.

Univ. of California/Los Angeles (UCLA):
	CS: @cs.ucla.edu @oahu.cs.ucla.edu
      MATH: @math.ucla.edu, @sonia.math.ucla.edu, @oak.math.ucla.edu
		(graduate students, staff, faculty)
	EE grads & faculty: ee.ucla.edu (network of RTs and SUNs
	   running unix. Each machine has the name of a famous
	   engineer:  watt.ee.ucla.edu, joule.ee.ucla.edu, etc)
	   Usernames vary; try fname, lastname,...
	AGSM: @agsm.ucla.edu  @uclagsm
	      (Anderson Graduate School of Management)
	      All of students , staffs and faculty have their user ID.
	      User ID: FLLLLLLL (max 8 characters)
	Class Accounts: pic.ucla.edu (PIC = program in computing)
	   These get cleared every quarter. Account names are usually
	   the course number followed by three letters chosen by the student.
	   If you finger @laguna.pic.ucla.edu, you get more detailed
	   info, such as when the user last logged on, etc.
	Engineering: seas.ucla.edu  This is a server for a network for
	   the school of engineering and applied sciences. Any engineering
	   graduate student can get an account on it, and many undergrads
	   have accounts on it for classes. This machine has access to
	   USENET.
	Anybody: oac.ucla.edu  An IBM 3090.  Anyone in UCLA can get an
	   open access account on this to send mail, etc.  Account
	   names on this machine are terribly cryptic (such as IZZYR33). 

Univ. of California/Santa Cruz:
	Undergrads: ucscb.ucsc.edu
	Other hosts include ucsc{c-e,o}.ucsc.edu, ucscvm.ucsc.edu, etc.  All
	these hosts (except for ucscb) are on bitnet as the first part of
	their domain name.
	A new host, cats.ucsc.edu, has been added as the mail address for
	UCSC's version of Athena. Users can be fingered by username, first
	name, or last name. Undergrads, grads, faculty, and some staff may
	have accounts on cats.  Users choose their own IDs, so you must use
	finger to get an account name.
	As of late fall 1992, the name space of cats and ucscb have been
	merged, so that almost all students have the same userid on both
	systems.  However, there are (and will likely always be) separate
	accounts on the 2 systmes that use the same name - so there will
	remain differences between mailing to SomeAddress@cats and
	SomeAddress@ucscb.

Univ. of California/San Diego (UCSD):
	The primary mail gateway is ucsd.edu. This machine also has a
	smart finger program, which will look up names that sound similar
	to the one you fingered. Just "finger name@ucsd.edu".

	Most usernames are the initial of the first name followed by the
	last name, truncated to 8 characters, ie. "jfowler@ucsd.edu", but
	this is not always the case (because most people don't like their
	names truncated).

	Machine sdcc13 houses the student personal accounts at present, but
	mail to ucsd.edu will reach (almost) everyone on sdcc13.ucsd.edu.

	If the person is a graduate student, faculty member, or staff
	member try: weber (social sciences), cogsci (guess), bend
	(linguistics), crl (some developmental psychology people).

	Many, many other machines house course, faculty, staff, and research
	accounts.  Your best bet is to look the name up at ucsd.edu.

Univ. of Central Florida (Orlando)
	CS dept: only grad students are given accounts. finger
	  lastname@eola.cs.ucf.edu
	Engineering: finger initials@apocalypse.engr.ucf.edu
	General: ucf1vm.cc.ucf.edu.  (A bitnet node, so you cannot finger)

Univ. of Chicago:
	Undergraduates: midway.uchicago.edu (formerly tank.uchicago.edu)
	  (midway.uchicago.edu serves as a mail server for machines
	  named quads.uchicago.edu and ellis.uchicago.edu. When midway
	  refuses connections, finger at quad or ellis.)	
	Grads and faculty may also be on quads and ellis.
	CS Grads: gargoyle.uchicago.edu
	Math: zaphod.uchicago.edu
	Education: paideia.uchicago.edu
	Chemistry: pico.uchicago.edu
	Astronomy: oddjob.uchicago.edu (finger lastname)
	Social sciences (Economics, History, Sociology, Political Science):
	  cicero.spc.uchicago.edu [also accepts 'finger']
	Also Try: uchep.uchicago.edu

	Many researchers have accounts on rainbow.uchicago.edu, in
	  addition to having accounts on their own workstations.
	The University of Chicago now (fall91) runs the ph mail
	  system, so sending mail to finitial-lastname@uchicago.edu will
	  work if they've entered a real mailbox into their ph entry. 
	  In case of name conflict, add additional initials beyond the
	  first. Questions should be directed to advisor@midway.uchicago.edu.
	  Unfortunately few people bother to input their e-mail addresses.

Univ. of Chile (Universidad de Chile) (in Santiago, Chile, South America):
	Mathematics and Physical Sciences Campus (includes engineering)	
 	  All students that ask for an account can get one on araucaria:
 	    araucaria.cec.uchile.cl (Sun 690MP), uchcecvm.bitnet (IBM 390)
 	  All students that have a class involving computers get an account on:
 	    cipres.cec.uchile.cl    (Sun 690MP)
	  Professors, researchers, and research assistents:
	    tamarugo.cec.uchile.cl  (Sun 690MP)
	Computer Science (Departamento Ciencia de la Computacion)
	  All Computer Science students and professors have an account on:
	    dcc.uchile.cl           (Sun 4/470)
	  Professors, researchers, and grad students of Computer Science
	    tortel.dcc.uchile.cl    (Sun SS II)
	  For more information access the gopher server (using normal gopher
	  access or telnet/rlogin with login name "gopher") on tortel.

Univ. of Colorado/Boulder:			Changed: Tue Feb 23 1993
	Finger name@colorado.edu, where name is lastname, firstname, or
	  firstname-lastname.  At the upper right of the directory information
	  is a username and machine; their address is then
	  username@machine.colorado.edu
	Telnet to directory.colorado.edu, using username "directory".
	This lets you access the online phonebook/email address book.

Univ. of Connecticut:
	uconn.edu
	userid@nicky.uconn.edu
	CS Undergrads: ug1.eng1.uconn.edu
	CS Grads and Faculty: cse1.cse.uconn.edu 
	CS Research and Grads: sparc0.brc.uconn.edu

This is the last third of the summary of how to find email addresses
for undergraduate and graduate students, faculty and staff at various
colleges and universities.

Univ. of Dayton (Ohio):
	School of Engineering: udecc.engr.udayton.edu
	CPS: udcps3.cps.udayton.edu
	General: udavxb.oca.udayton.edu

Univ. of Delaware:
	All undergraduate students, graduate students and faculty have
	accounts on the university system. The computer name is 
	   brahms.udel.edu
	also there are chopin.udel.edu, bach.udel.edu and ravel.udel.edu, but
	these are redundant because they share accounts and files with brahms.
	The login name is a random 5-digit number until the user changes it,
	then it is whatever the user picks. Fingering last names will work to
	find the login name, but since there are thousands of accounts, it may
	produce an overload of information.

	The College of Marine Studies maintains a computer system. Students
	and faculty have accounts with login names of their choosing on
	several computers, such as
	   earthview.cms.udel.edu
	   mingming.cms.udel.edu
	   chester.cms.udel.edu
	There are several other sparcstations around but they share accounts
	with the ones named above. 

Univ. of Florida (Gainesville, FL):
	Finger lastname@wasp.eng.ufl.edu. Contains complete listings
	for people in the College of Engineering, and some listings
	for people in other departments.

Univ. of Houston (Houston, Texas)			Changed: Mon Feb 15 1993
	Host: cs.uh.edu.: All graduate students, staff, and faculty in the CS
	  dept.  have accounts on cs.uh.edu. Undergrads have accounts on
	  either menudo.uh.edu (Unix) or jetson.uh.edu (VAX).
	Try "finger lastname@cs.uh.edu" for information on graduate students,
	  staff, or faculty. Use "finger lastname@menudo.uh.edu" or "finger
	  lastname@jetson.uh.edu" for undergrads.
	Anonymous ftp host: beethoven.cs.uh.edu (129.7.5.180)
	Undergraduate and graduate information can be found under pub/gradinfo.
	To request for information and/or application forms, send name and
	  address to gradinfo@cs.uh.edu

Univ. of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign:		Changed: Tue Feb 23 1993
	In general, finger name@uicc.edu, where name can be firstname,
	  lastname, or firstname-lastname
	CS: try mail to lastname@cs.uiuc.edu or flastname@cs.uiuc.edu
	Campus: try mail to f-lastname@uiuc.edu and firstname-lastname@uiuc.edu 
	Student Accounts: As of Fall 1992: ux4.cso.uicc.edu (those entering
	  before then have accounts on uxa.cso.uiuc.edu)  Every freshman gets
	  an account on this machine. Usernames are usually flastname (old
	  accounts were the user's three initials, followed by five random
	  characters.)
	CS/Grad Stud Research: m.cs.uiuc.edu (Encore Multimax)
	Math (Grads, Faculty, Staff): lastname@math.uiuc.edu
	Classes: ux1.cso.uiuc.edu, hendrix.ece.uiuc.edu
	   (Purely instructional. 1 semester accounts on this machine.)
	Faculty: are mostly on ux1.cso.uiuc.edu
		whois -h uiuc.edu <names>

	It is usually possible to send mail to f-lastname@uiuc.edu or
	firstname-lastname@uiuc.edu. If that fails, you will get a
	message which tells you why the email could not be sent.

	From BITNET, it is possible to get information about any student by
	executing the command 'TELL PHSERVE AT UIUCVMD firstname
	lastname RETURN ALL.'

Univ. of Illinois/Chicago: uicvm.cc.uic.edu (userids of the form Uxxxxx)

Univ. of Iowa:
	Engineers - on the Apollo ring
	          - @icaen.uiowa.edu
	          - First Inital Middle Initial Last Name        
	Others    - @weeg.uiowa.edu        


Univ. of Kansas:
	Student Accounts: kuhub.cc.ukans.edu
	Most user ID's are their last names (first 6 letters).

Univ. of Kentucky:
       The WHOIS server at UK maintains user databases for the following 
       Kentucky universities:

	University of Kentucky, Lexington, KY
	University of Louisville, Louisville, KY
	Morehead State University, Morehead, KY
	Murray State University, Murray, KY
	Transylvania University, Lexington, KY
	Western Kentucky University, Bowling Green, KY
	Eastern Kentucky University, Richmond, KY
	Northern Kentucky University, Highland Heights, KY

       SENDING COMMANDS TO WHOIS
       =========================

       If you have BITNET access, you can query the WHOIS server interactively,
       using the TELL command.  For instance:
	       TELL WHOIS AT UKCC WHOIS FOOBLE
		    or
	       TELL WHOIS AT UKCC GUESS AT NKU BOOGLE

       If you don't have access to BITNET, you can query the WHOIS server via 
       electronic mail.  Send your email to whois@ukcc.uky.edu, and place your
       commands in the body (NOT the Subject line) of the message. The HELP
       command will send you back a full list of commands.


UNLV:
	Student Accounts: redrock.nevada.edu
	uns-helios.nevada.edu is used by some students, but may be
	changing into a research machine.

Univ. of Louisville: @ULKYVX.BITNET

Univ. of Maine:
	Campus mainframe: username@maine.bitnet
	CS Faculty and Students: userid@gandalf.umcs.maine.edu

Univ. of Maryland:

	All students (grad and undergrad) may request an account on
	wam.umd.edu (Workstations At Maryland).  All undergrads (and
	probably graduate students too) may request accounts on
	eng.umd.edu; most engineering graduate students have accounts
	on eng.umd.edu. Finger using the lastname at these hosts.

	CS Faculty/Staff/Graduate Students: cs.umd.edu

	telnet info.umd.edu and login as lookup for faculty/staff
	E-mail directory.  Campus has universal faculty/staff E-mail
	on info.umd.edu (aka umail.umd.edu).  Whois and finger do not
	work off campus for this computer, though.  If you know the name, try 
	firstname_lastname@umail.umd.edu.
 
Univ. of Massachusetts/Amherst:
	Students/Faculty: first.{mi.}last@student.umass.edu (This is
	on the CDC Cyber NOS/VE system.) Another common format is
	first.{mi.}last@saturn.ucc.umass.edu. Saturn is the name
	of the computer. Many people, especially faculty, have a 
	departmental abbreviation in place of "student" or
	"saturn.ucc".
	Graduate CS students: cs.umass.edu Username is person's lastname.
	Intro CS courses: S#######@tethys.ucc.umass.edu, where #######
	is a 7-digit student number. 
	Engineering: {fi}lastname@ecs.umass.edu. Names defaults to
	last name, but may include the first initial if the last name
	is not unique.
	Student directory service: (413)-545-1515 for finding a phone number.

Univ. of Massachusetts/Lowell:
	All CS students and University UNIX users are generally
	addressable as flllllll@cs.ulowell.edu. Adjustments are made
	for conflicts such as adding the middle initial after the
	first, or adding additional letters from the first name.

	Not all students automatically get accounts on the VMS system,
	but if they do they can be addressed as llllllf@woods.ulowell.edu.
	Finger works on this machine, but isn't very informative. If there is 
	a name conflict, they will add letters from the first name or numeric
	digits (1, 2, etc.) until it is unique.


Univ. of Michigan:
	The best place to try to find an e-mail address for a faculty,
	students, and staff at U-M is via the X.500 White Pages service.
	There are many ways in which this can be accessed, but one easy
	way is through finger (finger firstname.lastname@umich.edu).
	(The X.500 Directory also contains business addresses, business
	phone numbers, titles, and home addresses and phone numbers in
	the case where the person has granted such permission.)
	If the person has registered an e-mail address, it will appear;
	if the person has not, follow the advice of the X.500 server and
	try fingering the person at um.cc.umich.edu (the mainframe),
	caen.engin.umich.edu (the College of Engineering mail hub), or
	med.umich.edu (the Medical Campus mail hub).

	People with accounts on um.cc.umich.edu also have a Bitnet
	address:  USERxxx@UMICHUM.BITNET where 'xxxx' is the person's
	account on the mainframe.

	A database of U of Michigan student and faculty phone numbers
	and addresses (not email addresses, just phones) is available through
	the "gopher" server running at gopher.uis.itd.umich.edu port 70, also 
	available via telnet to gopher.micro.umn.edu (login: gopher) in the
	"Other gophers" menu or the "phone books" menu. This gopher
	phone number database has been changed to access X.500.

	Grad students in EECS get accounts on eecs.umich.edu. (The
	specific machine names are dip and zip, but eecs forwards
	appropriately.)

	Usernames are either lastname, or of the form Fname_Lname.
	313- ann arbor info 764-1817 998-7999

	If all else fails, you can always mail the request to the U-M
	postmaster at postmaster@umich.edu.

	Alternately:
		telnet to 35.1.48.149 35.1.48.150 or hermes.merit.edu
		press return until you get a "Which Host?" prompt
		type FINGER UM <return> NAME <return>
		to get finger information for NAME

Univ. of Minnesota:				Changed: Mon Feb 15 1993
	In general, try fingering fname.mname.lname@umn.edu.

	CS Grad students: @cs.umn.edu.  General policy is "last name as
	account name, plus first and middle initials if that's not unique",
	but there *are* exceptions.

	Undergrads in technical majors will have temporary accounts on
	staff.tc.umn.edu or vx.cis.umn.edu.  The account names are serialized
	so aren't useful in finding out names.  Recently (as of late 1992)
	most class accounts are on mermaid.micro.umn.edu, and are named.  All
	Twin Cities campus students have e-mail on student.tc.umn.edu, whether
	they know it or not.

	Chemistry (faculty, staff, grads): lname@chemsun.chem.umn.edu
	The login is usually the person's last name, although there
	are some exceptions.

	Statistics: umnstat.stat.umn.edu.  Userid varies; use finger.

Univ. of Missouri/Rolla:
	cs.umr.edu

Univ. of Missouri/St. Louis:
	CS: arch.umsl.edu 
	    This machine isn't fingerable, but its address info is
	    available by fingering at aber.umsl.edu.

	Undergrads: clemens.umsl.edu, twain.umsl.edu
	The id can be obtained by fingering either of these machines using the
	last name of the student.

Univ. of Montreal				Changed: Mon Feb 15 1993
	General: username@ere.umontreal.ca
	Usernames are typically last names (maximum = 8 letters).

Univ. of Nebraska at Omaha:
       Undergraduate Students and Faculty: zeus.unomaha.edu (unoma1.bitnet)
	 Main academic VAX running VMS.
	 All computer science students receive academic accounts of the
	 form CCXXX where CC is a 2-character class code and XXX is a number
	 from 000 (usually the instructor) up to 999 (usually smaller than
	 050 in practice).  These accounts are reset each semester
       
	 Permanent accounts are also on Zeus, usually a last name or
	 nickname.  Permanent student accounts are of the form ZAXXX
	 for unaffiliated students, or organizational forms like ACMXXX
	 and IEEEXXX for members of their respective student organizations.

	 Any undergraduate student who asks nicely can get a ZA account,
	 or an organizational account if they are a member.

      Graduate Students and Faculty: odin.unomaha.edu
	Main campus Unix workstation (running DEC Ultrix)
	Finger by login ID (usually some form of the name) or by proper name.

	Any graduate student or senior undergrad pursuing an academic
	project can get an Odin account.

      Math/CS Students and Faculty: unocss.unomaha.edu (not fingerable)

      UNO Chapter of the Association for Computing Machinery: acm.unomaha.edu
	All members have accounts, usually some form of the name (not 
	fingerable, this computer is also the former unocss.unomaha.edu in
	case you haven't guessed).  Polite mail to postmaster@acm.unomaha.edu
	may yield information about an ACM member or math/CS student.

Univ. of Nebraska at Lincoln:
	Engineering: engvms.unl.edu
	Computing Staff and some students: crcvms.unl.edu
	CS students: cse.unl.edu

	All students above the classification of sophomore have name accounts
	on cse.unl.edu (first initial appended to the last name) but you can
	also finger the machine.

Univ. of New Brunswick: (Fredericton, NB, Canada)

	Computing Services: csd.unb.ca

	All students are automatically given MUSIC accounts on the VM
	service and can send and receive mail, however, there is at
	present no easy way to determine the MUSIC id knowing the name
	of the student.  Depending on course requirements, students may
	also have accounts on the MVS or UNIX systems.

	Requests for non-student userids can be sent to our on-line
	directory server.  Send mail to Directry@UNB.Ca, If the 1st
	non-blank line of the mail is Help or Find name, the name will be
	searched and the results mailed back to the address in the From:
	field of the mail.  The server is bilingual (English/French) and
	will also respond to the commands Aide or Recherche name.

	MVS machine:	unbmvs1.csd.UNB.ca
	VM machine:	unbvm1.csd.UNB.ca
	UNIX machine:	jupiter.sun.csd.UNB.ca	(finger works)


Univ. of New Hampshire:
	
	General university users: unhh.unh.edu (same as
	hilbert.unh.edu).  User names, both student and staff, are
	generally of the form F_LAST where F is the person's first
	initial and LAST is the person's last name.  

	CS class accounts and undergrad CS: kepler.unh.edu.  User
	names are usually the person's initials (sometimes postfixed
	by a 3 digit course number for intro classes).

	Grad CS and Faculty:  cs.unh.edu.  With only a few exceptions,
	all logins are the person's initials.

Univ. of New Mexico
	Try finger lastname@carina.unm.edu.  User names are usually of the
	form FLLLLLLL (8 characters max).  Accounts may be on many different
	hosts within unm.edu but the finger database on carina seems to know
	where all the accounts are.  If carina is unavailable try vesta.

Univ. of North Carolina at Chapel Hill:
	CS: All CS students get an account on the network of workstations.
	The login is usually just the first 8 characters of the student's
	last name. Name conflicts are usually resolved by appending
	the first initial and/or the middle initial to the last name.
	Mail may be sent to username@cs.unc.edu. You may finger both by
	userid and real name at cs.unc.edu.
	Faculty and Staff: One can get an email address from the online
	phonebook. 
	   telnet to 128.109.157.1
	   login as info
	   follow the menus to Campus Directory
	OR
	   telnet to 128.109.157.150
   	   a couple of returns
 	   at '#' prompt type info
	   follow menus to Campus Directory
	Medical School: students, staff, and faculty.
		finger name@boone.med.unc.edu 
		finger name@winton.med.unc.edu 
	(They alternate each incoming year between the 2 servers to 
	parcel out disk space better, so fingering @med.unc.edu won't
	work. However, once you know the user id, send mail to
	user@med.unc.edu.) 


Univ. of North Carolina at Charlotte:
 	userid@mosaic.uncc.edu
	Userids are of the form fmlastname.

Univ. of North Dakota: see North Dakota Network

Univ. of North Florida
	CS undergrads, grads, faculty: flast@unf6.cis.unf.edu, where last may
	  be limited to 6-8 characters.
	Information Science undergrads: unf1vm.cis.unf.edu.  Unfortunately
	  names are assigned randomly, so it's nearly impossible to guess
	  unless you already have contact with someone.
	Others generally don't have accounts unless they ask for them.

Univ. of Notre Dame:

	The University of Notre Dame now supports full name human readable
	e-mail addresses, such as John.Q.Student.1@nd.edu.  All members
	of the Notre Dame community have e-mail addresses on nd.edu; however,
	at this time (June, 1992) the vast majority of them are
	"uninitialized".  This means the user has not specifically told the
	server how to deliver e-mail to this user, so e-mail to this user will
	fail.

	All members of the Notre Dame community also have userids in our AFS
	file space.  Userids in this file space tend to be of the form
	flllllll or flllllln.  Some users who use the AFS file system might
	not have initialized their entries on the nd.edu name server;
	conversely, many community members who can receive mail via nd.edu
	ignore their AFS userids.

	Notre Dame also has many other central and departmental computer
	systems which can send and receive e-mail.  As more and more users
	initialize their nameserver accounts there will be less need to
	remember these specific local systems and userids.  However, for the
	time being, they are often the best addresses for some members
	of the Notre Dame community.

	All students are given accounts on darwin.cc.nd.edu, but not
	all students use them. Usernames are of the form flllllll. In
	case of name conflicts, numbers are added to the end to disambiguate.

	Questions can be sent to info@nd.edu.

Univ. of Oklahoma/Norman:
	flllllll@uokmax.ecn.uoknor.edu

Univ. of Oregon:
	CS Grads and Faculty: <username>@cs.uoregon.edu
	CS Undergrads/CIE: <username>@cie.uoregon.edu (this is only
	for CS undergrads subscribing to the campus information
	exchange) 
	Others?: fmlast@oregon.uoregon.edu for those with email accounts
	U-mail:	first.middle.last@oregon.uoregon.edu for those without
	email. Such letters are printed out with a cover sheet and
	delivered through the normal campus mail system (graduate
	students, staff, and faculty only -- undergrads do not have
	on-campus addresses).

Univ. of Pennsylvania:
	Undergrad engineering, SEAS course accounts: eniac.seas.upenn.edu
	Undergrad/Grad Business: wharton.upenn.edu
 	  (all business students can get an account if they want one)
	  Lastname plus two number identification string (arbitrary)
  	Grad CS: grad1.cis.upenn.edu
	CS faculty/staff: central.cis.upenn.edu
	Medical School: lastname_firstinitial@a1.mscf.upenn.edu
		Medical students, biomed grad students, and some faculty
		have accounts on this system.

	Try whois -h whois.upenn.edu lname, or
	    whois -h whois.upenn.edu ?      for help.

Univ. of Pittsburgh: 
	Students get their choice of Unix or VMS accounts, addressed
	as user@unix.cis.pitt.edu and user@vms.cis.pitt.edu,
	respectively. Student user names are of the form fmlst, where
	fml are their initials and "st" stands for "student". To
	finger the VMS accounts you must finger at vm1.cis.pitt.edu or
	vm2.cis.pitt.edu. Mail addressed to user@cis.pitt.edu won't be
	rejected, but doesn't seem to be readable for the user's VMS account.
	Computer Science	: cs.pitt.edu
	Electrical Eng		: ee.pitt.edu
	Library & Info Science  : lis.pitt.edu
	Medical School          : med.pitt.edu

Univ. of Rochester:
	Undergraduate, Student Staff, and a few others: uhura.cc.rochester.edu 
	    (fingerd has been re-enabled on uhura, but will be permanently
	     disabled if finger attacks resume)
	All incoming students now receive accounts on uhura - but whether they
	    use them is another matter.
	Graduate CS: cs.rochester.edu 	
	Class Accounts, Faculty, and Graduate:  troi.cc.rochester.edu 	
	Psychology: prodigal.psych.rochester.edu

	Anyone _who does not already have an account on another
	machine_ can also get an account on db1.cc.rochester.edu (vax). 
 
	Whois server: whois -h db1.cc.rochester.edu <name> 
		Gives phone but not email for most faculty and staff at the
		University of Rochester and Strong Memorial Hospital.

	Userids are set up as follows: (Where xxxx is a 4 letter code based on
	your name, yyy is a 3 character random code and DPCRN is
	DePartment, Course Reference Number)
	   xxxx_ltd:  Standard account before August 1992; anyone can get one 
	   flnnnx:    Standard accounts for incoming students and all new
	              limited accounts. (fl initials, nnn a number, x a letter)
	   xxxx_ss:   Student Staff
	   xxxx_eng:  Some english accounts
	   xxxx:      Usually system staff or administrators
	   yyydpcrn:  Class accounts (I.E. aa1CS100 would be a computer science

	following mail adresses:
	  NTH (Norw. Inst of Techn.) : userid@solan.unit.no
	  AVH (Coll. of Arts and Science) firstname.lastname@avh.unit.no
	A postmaster service exists at both sites.  Employees and
	students at AVH can also be found in the EAN Directory Service.

	The Norwegian Institute of Technology, aka NTH (Norges Tekniske
	Hoegskole).  All students at NTH have the right to open an account on
	the the email machines, but this right is not very heavily advertized,
	so most people don't use the machines.  Login names may be FLLLLLLL,
	LLLLLLLL, FFFFFFFF, FMLLLLLL, or (for people with very common first
	and last names) MMMMMMMM (8 characters maximum).  FLLLLLLL is probably
	the most common; MMMMMMMM and especially FMLLLLLL is probably quite
	rare.  LLLLLLLL and FFFFFFFFF may be used if the user's last or first
	names are not not very common, especially if they are foreign.

Univ. of the Pacific:

Univ. of Utah: 
      For accounts being managed by the University of Utah Computer Center,
      and any accounts that the department have turned in to the center, the
      directory is on
	 PH.CC.UTAH.EDU
      and is accessible via the internet PH protocol.  It is also accessible
      via the GOPHER program and it's related protocols.  A limited version
      is availiable via the finger server at PH.CC.UTAH.EDU It is from this
      directory that the printed e-mail directory is made.

	CS Graduate Students: asylum.utah.edu
	CS Undergraduate Students: peruvian.utah.edu
	Pre-majors: cadehp0.eng.utah.edu
	CS Department: cs.utah.edu is the cs department main machine,
	  for faculty, staff, and grads.

	Lots of departments have machines: [Very incomplete list]
	Elec. Eng.: 	ee.utah.edu
	Mathematics: 	math.utah.edu
	Physics: 	physics.utah.edu
	Chemistry:	chemistry.utah.edu    
	Chem. Eng.:	che.utah.edu
	Mech. Eng.:	mech.utah.edu
	Civ. Eng.:	civil.utah.edu
	Biology:	biology.utah.edu
	Mining:		mines.utah.edu

	postmaster@xanadu.cc.utah.edu  is the postmaster for more than half of
		  the email accounts on campus, but not any cs machines.
	postmaster@cs.utah.edu   is postmaster for CS machines
	postmaster@m.cc.utah.edu is postmaster for most unassigned students
	postmaster@science.utah.edu  is postmaster for College of
		Science Machines. 
	postmaster@cc.utah.edu gets most unassigned departments.
	postmaster@m.cc.utah.edu gets most unassigned students.
	postmaster@cave.cc.utah.edu  gets cavers and most imaginary users.

	The medical center handles their own stuff separately, but
	they often appear in the online directory at ph.cc.utah.edu

Univ. of Vermont:
	There are two main computing organizations on campus: 
	UCS (University Computing Services) and
	EMBA-CF (Division of Engineering, Mathematics, and Business
	Administration, Computer Facility).  As a general rule, 
	people with accounts at EMBA-CF do not bother to obtain accounts at
	UCS.  UVM's domain name is `uvm.edu', and sub-domains are not
	generally used.  Most of the UVM network has most TCP ports blocked
	off, but one machine, emily.uvm.edu, can serve as a gateway for, for
	example, the finger program,  (i.e., finger
	someone@somehost@emily.uvm.edu.) 

	UCS has three main machines: uvmvax.uvm.edu (UVMVAX.BITNET),
	uvmvm.uvm.edu (UVMVM.BITNET), and UVMADMIN.BITNET.  Accounts on UVMVAX
	(a VMS system) are generally of the form Lastname_F; accounts on
	UVMVM and UVMADMIN don't seem to follow any particular scheme, but
	Lastname and LastnameF seem to be popular.  Many UCS staff people use
	their initials.  UVMVAX supports unspecified finger only; UVMVM
	doesn't support finger at all.

	EMBA-CF supports computing for the departments of Math/Stat, Business
	Administration, CS/EE, and Civil/Mechanical Engineering, as well as
	the administration of the College of Engineering and Mathematics; all
	students, faculty, and staff in the Division are entitled to an
	account, although many students do not bother to get a
	non-class account. Sometimes, other people may be given
	accounts on EMBA-CF machines. 

	EMBA-CF has three separate mail-spool servers, and users are free
	to forward their mail to whichever one they happen to prefer; these
	machines are uvm-gen.uvm.edu, hal.uvm.edu, and trantor.uvm.edu.
	uvm-gen is also known as just plain UVM.EDU, and most faculty and
	staff with accounts at EMBA-CF have a alias of the form
	Firstname{.M}.Lastname installed at uvm-gen.  All other users, except
	for class and staff accounts, are assigned by last name, with a
	numeric suffix in case of collision.  Staff accounts for work-study
	employees are usually of the form operfml.  Class accounts are of the
	form ddNNNfml, where dd is the department
	(cs,ce,me,ee,ma,st,ba) and NNN is the class number; in case of
	collision, the class number or middle initial may be changed.

	There are two sub-domains: msg.uvm.edu belongs to Mach Systems Group,
	a group of graduate students involved porting operating systems (most
	notably, Mach 2.5 and 3.0) to local hardware; and med.uvm.edu belongs
	to the UVM School of Medicine, which is not very well networked as
	yet.

Univ. of Virginia:
	More or less all students, faculty, and staff can have
	accounts that at least receive mail, but most people don't
	ever bother to get or use an account.  People in the School of
	Engineering are most likely to be accessible via e-mail.  The
	school's primary connections are Internet links to SURAnet
	(local NSF Regional network), but there is also a single
	BITNET link.  Almost any user can be located using the
	Internet standard whois program and the whois database that
	is kept on the system named: whois.virginia.edu
	You can also try fingering lname@virginia.edu.

Univ. of Washington, Seattle:
	CS Grads and Faculty: lastname@cs.washington.edu

	Most folks are on milton.u.washington.edu, which is the same as
	u.washington.edu. Usernames can be anything. Mail sent via
	u.washington.edu will forward to the appropriate account.

	CS students, grads, and faculty can generally be looked up by last
	name at cs.washington.edu; if not, try june.cs.washington.edu for
	grads and faculty, and wolf.cs.washington.edu for undergrads.

Univ. of Waterloo, Ontario: 
    Userids are of of the form <initials>+<surname> (e.g. mbmulroney, ghwbush),
	and may be any length (for most machines; some still restrict them to
	8 characters.  Mail servers send you back a list of possible userids
	if the one you tried doesn't match any known user.
    Math/CS undergraduates: undergrad.math.uwaterloo.ca
    CS graduate students: neumann.uwaterloo.ca
    CS and Math Graduate Students: violet.uwaterloo.ca and jeeves.uwaterloo.ca
    CS faculty may be found on one or more of the primary machines
	{watdragon, maytag, watcgl, daisy, jeeves, grand, poppy, vlsi, watmsg,
	  math, watserv1}.uwaterloo.ca (there are lots more)
    Engineering undergraduate students: userid usually of form
	<surname>+<initials> or <initials>+<surname>, at one of
	{chemical, civil, electrical, mechanical}.watstar.uwaterloo.ca
  	Also try @1302 and @108 for chemical, civil, electrical and mechanical
	engineering -- these are used mainly for lower-year students
	from all engineering departments.
    Systems Design Engineering: watnow.uwaterloo.ca
    Physics students: physics.watstar.uwaterloo.ca.
    Art Students:  artspas.watstar.uwaterloo.ca.

Univ. of Western Ontario, London, Ontario:
	Computing and Communications Services operates a campus directory
	service as well as a campus E-mail forwarding service. This covers
	all of the faculty and staff listed in the campus telephone directory
	as well as many students. Registration is voluntary but for faculty
	and staff is reasonably complete and accurate.
	  % whois -h whohost.uwo.ca name
	  eg. whois -h whohost.uwo.ca smith
	  eg. whois -h whohost.uwo.ca j.smith
	  eg. whois -h whohost.uwo.ca john.smith
	The mail forwarding service works for common names as well:
	  % mail common-name@uwo.ca
	  eg. mail smith@uwo.ca
	  eg. mail j.smith@uwo.ca
	  eg. mail john.smith@uwo.ca
	Mail will either be forwarded to the user with that common name, or
	if the name is not unique, you will receive a returned message listing
	all users with that common name.

Univ. of Wisconsin/La Crosse: 
	username@uwlax.edu 
	Usernames are arbitrary. Try fingering by the lastname.

Univ. of Wisconsin/Madison:
	Phone book server (staff only): finger lname@wisc.edu
	CS: cs.wisc.edu
	Engineering: cae.wisc.edu
	Undergrads: Class accounts based on first and last name,
	  @garfield.cs.wisc.edu.
	For other departments, you can sometimes guess the hostname
	  from the department name.  Thus: meteor.wisc.edu for
	  Meteorology, math.wisc.edu for Mathematics.

Univ. of Wisconsin - Milwaukee:
   Many students - csd4.csd.uwm.edu, convex.csd.uwm.edu
   EE ugrad and grad - ee.uwm.edu
   CS grad - point.cs.uwm.edu
   CS fac - blatz.cs.uwm.edu
   Students taking Comp Sci Classes: miller.cs.uwm.edu

   In fact if you finger cs.uwm.edu you get:

   Computer Science users at UWM are normally on workstations or
   other backbone computing machines. To locate a faculty member,
   graduate student or undergraduate student, you can use the
   finger program.

   The finger program can help you locate a user who is known to the CS
   machines at UWM. To locate a user do

	   finger person-X@cs.uwm.edu

	   Where   X=F|f   if the person is a CS faculty member
		   X=G|g   if the person is a CS grad student
		   X=U|u   if the person is a CS undergraduate student
		   X=E|e   if the person is an Engineering student
		   X=O|o   Other University machines(Just some of them!)

   Undergraduates are for the most part on miller.cs.uwm.edu. Graduate
   students are usually on cvax.cs.uwm.edu. To get a complete list of
   cs-faculty, finger csfac@cs.uwm.edu.
	

Univ. of Wisconsin - River Falls:
	uwrf.bitnet

Utah State University:
	cc.usu.edu - This is the MAIN VAX. A Vax 6510 that is usually the
		     system that everyone uses for most purposes. Our
		     usenet news is on this computer as well as other 
		     utilities. This is also the system that is a bitnet
		     node (USU). So mail can be sent to usu.bitnet as well.
       mua.usu.edu - This is our Micro-VAX that is running ultrix. Because
		     this is the popular domain for TinyTALK and TinyFUGUE
		     programs, the active Gamers use this system. 

	You can finger both systems, the account names are given in a random
	fashion that consists of a five letter code. The first two
	letters usually denoting whether the user is a student or a
	faculty member. SL___ account belong to students and FA___
	accounts belong to faculty members.  The easiest way to locate
	a user is to send mail to OPERATOR@cc.usu.edu or, if your
	system supports the bitnet SEND command, use SEND OPERATOR@USU
	and ask them to look up the name for you.

Vanderbilt University:
	Engineering faculty and grad students: @vuse.vanderbilt.edu
	  (most user IDs are the three initials)

	Undergrads and other grad students: @ctrvax.vanderbilt.edu
	  Most user IDs are llllllfm (8 chars max).  You can't finger
	  on this VAX cluster; try sending mail to
	  userserv@ctrvax.vanderbilt.edu; you should get a response
	  within a business day or so.

Vassar:
	Students: FMLLLLLLLLLL@vaxsar.vassar.edu. (Every student is given
	a VAX account, but few actually use them.)
	Faculty: Faculty must request an account in order to get it,
	but most of those who have accounts use them. Faculty
	usernames are lastnames followed by enough letters of the
	first name to ensure uniqueness. Their accounts are also on
	vaxsar.vassar.edu. Fingering with the username or the lastname
	will usually work.

Virginia Tech:

	Computer Science students at Virginia Tech (aka VPI or VPI&SU for
	Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, normally just
	Virginia Tech, though) can be found at:

	EE: vtccts1.cc.vt.edu, eddie.ee.vt.edu
	CS: csugrad.cs.vt.edu

	Undergraduates: userid@csugrad.cs.vt.edu
	Graduate Students: userid@csgrad.cs.vt.edu
	Faculty: userid@vtopus.cs.vt.edu

	There is also the SSI Mail account. If a person has an SSI Mail
	account it will be: firstInitialLastName@vtssi.vt.edu. It is common
	for undergrad students (especially non-CS) to get an SSI Mail account
	rather than a CSU account because it doesn't cost any money.

Wake Forest University:
	llllllfm@wfunet.wfu.edu

Washington University, St. Louis MO: 
	Arts&Sciences undergrads: fmllllll@pear.wustl.edu
	Undergrad Engineers: All have accounts on cec1.wustl.edu and
	  cec2.wustl.edu (cec2.uucp).  Userids are the user's three initials
	  followed by a single digit for disambiguating name conflicts. If
	  there is no name conflict, the extra digit is a 1. Fingering from
	  outside the university sometimes works. Also, some computer science
	  students have accounts on wucs1, and anyone (including people
	  outside W.U.) can have an account on maria. On these machines, the
	  user chooses his/her own login name to be enabled. Usernames for
	  engineering faculty are just their three initials.
	Other Undergrads: Try wugold.bitnet

Wayne State University, Detroit MI
	All students in the University, regardless of their major or college
	  can have access to an account.
	Engineering: ss0.eng.wayne.edu (or nova, or ece, or any solar planet,
	  e.g. sun, venus, ...)
	CS: jupiter.cs.wayne.edu, zeus.cs.wayne.edu
	These machines support finger.  Most other students' accounts
	  are on wu.cc.wayne.edu; try 'finger partial-name@wu.cc.wayne.edu'
	  to find information about anyone with "partial-name" in their name.

Wellesley College (Wellesley, Massachusetts)
	FLastname#@lucy.wellesley.edu, where F is first initial, and digit #
	is used only to disambiguate (e.g. JSMITH1).  Finger not accepted from
	remote sites.  Faculty names never get the #.

Wesleyan:
	Accounts are on eagle.wesleyan.edu. The username is of the
	form FLname, where F is the first initial and Lname is the
	lastname of the individual.

West Chester University:
	Users (at least undergraduates, if not others) are given 
	accounts on a machine whose name is the same as the first
	letter of their last name. Usernames are of the form fllllll.
	So John Doe would be jdoe%d%wcu@isn.wcupa.edu. Send mail
	to postmaster@isn.wcupa.edu if you have questions.

West Point, the United States Military Academy
	Host names are of the form usmaX.usma.edu, for X from 1 to 18.
	Try 'finger lastname@host', starting with usma18 (since lower-numbered
	machines tend to refuse a finger connection).  Actual mailboxes for
	cadets are of the form xYNNNNCC where x is the letter x, Y is last
	digit of graduating year (e.g. 6 for 1996), NNNN is a student ID code,
	and CC is company (letter-digit, e.g. D4).

Western Montana College
	Try f_llllllll@wmc.edu.  This site has no finger server.
	Address: 710 S. Pacific, Dillon, MT 59725

Wheaton College:
	UUCP: tellab5!wheaton!fmllllll

Widener University:
	General: First.Last@cyber.widener.edu (it may also need a
	middle initial)
	CS: lastname@cs.widener.edu

Willamette University, Salem OR:
	userid is <first initial><lastname> (e.g. ksmith) 
	up to 8 characters

	all students, faculty and staff
	<userid>@willamette.edu

Williams College:
	williams.bitnet. Username is YYFML (YY = year, F = first
	initial, M = middle initial, L = last initial). Some usernames
	have a _C postpended (YYFML_C).
	I believe this machine is vax.cc.williams.edu.
	Williams' postmaster will not give out user ids to outside
	requests.

Worcester Polytechnic Institute: 
	@wpi.wpi.edu

Yale:
	Fingering name@directory.yale.edu will give you all Unix people's
	email addresses, as well as their phone numbers.  Finger
	Finger@directory.yale.edu for further directions.

	Grad CS, Undergrad CS: lastname-firstname@cs.yale.edu (yalecs.bitnet)

	Undergrad Accounts (plus faculty & grad students in many non-CS
	Graduate School depts.): LLLFFFM@yalevm.ycc.yale.edu (or
	LLLFFFM@yalevm.bitnet). LLL is the first 3 letters of the last name,
	FFF is the first 3 letters of the first name, and M is the middle
	initial. Users can also request custom names.  Mail queries can go to
	consult@yalevm.bitnet or postmaster@cs.yale.edu, as appropriate. Some
	non-CS undergrads can be reached at lastname@minerva.cs.yale.edu.

	Medical School: yalemed.bitnet

York University (Toronto, Ontario)			Changed: Mon Feb 15 1993
	Try ``finger name@yorku.ca''  using first name, last name and probable
	  userid.  Also try ``whois -h horton.yorku.ca name'', also with first
	  and last names. The faculty and staff phone book is available on
	  gopher from gopher.yorku.ca and experimentally by ph from the same
	  machine.
	About 1/3 of the faculty and staff have email, and perhaps 1/8 of the
	  students.
	Faculty, Staff: userid@yorku.ca or userid@faculty.yorku.ca
	  Userids are often first-initial last-name, but do vary.
	Student userids do not follow a simple pattern. Students with email
	  are on ariel,yorku.ca (computer science), glade.yorku.ca (cs and
	  part-time students), writer.yorku.ca (computer aided writing centre)
	  and calumet.yorku.ca. Most of these clusters are fingerable. 
	Questions can be sent to postmaster@yorku.ca;  they're not too useful
	  when searching for students, as there is no student phonebook.
	  However ``whois -h horton.yorku.ca name''  discovers many student
	  adresses.
