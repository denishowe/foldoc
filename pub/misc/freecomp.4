Catalog of Free Compilers and Interpreters.

This list catalogues freely available software for language tools, which
includes the following: compilers, compiler generators, interpreters, 
translators, important libraries, assemblers, etc.  -- things whose user 
interface is a language.  Natural language processing tools may also 
be included.

This list is primarily aimed at developers rather than researchers, and
consists mainly of citations for production quality systems.  There is some
overlap of coverage between this document and other lists and catalogs.	 See
the references section for a list...

All the listed items should be free and come with source code, exceptions have
generally been deleted from the list in the past.  If you find any such items
in the list let me know and I'll remove them.

The latest version of the catalog can be ftp'ed: get
pub/compilers-list/free-compilers from idiom.berkeley.ca.us.

This catalog is available through World Wide Web.  A searchable
hypertext version can be accessed through http://cui_www.unige.ch/freecomp.
(As of the middle of January, the WWW version was still based on rev. 5.2)

Not all entries have complete citations.  Some fields are filled with question
marks (?).  Fields with both the ? and an entry are implicit requests for
confirmation.  Also, specific questions will often be asked [in brackets --ed].

Please send updates to <free-compilers@idiom.berkeley.ca.us>.  If you
fill out the template (see the first entry in the tools section) it is
a lot easier for me to keep things going.  

Thanks,

-Steve Robenalt

changes and history
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This document grew out of David Muir Sharnoff filing away postings that
he saw (mostly Ed Vielmetti's postings to comp.archives) during 1991 and
the first half of 1992.	 At the Summer 1992 USENIX Technical Conference,
the other attendees of the archivists BOF convinced David to compile his
data into a posting.  David posted for about one year, then turned the
list over to Mark Hopkins.  Mark Hopkins took care of it for the summer
of 1993 and then gave it back to David Sharnoff when it dropped off the
net.  Steve Robenalt <robenalt@orange.digex.net> has taken over the list
maintenance from Dave, but Dave's organization, Idiom Consulting, remains 
as the focal point for information to be submitted.

This month, it was called to my attention that there is a boycott of software
for the Macin
