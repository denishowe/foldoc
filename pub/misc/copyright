Hi there! I read your letter with interest; I don't have any
experience in this legal situation, so can't make much comment
on the issues. It sounds much better that stuff is copyright by
default... I also would have said that myself; the main slant
of my posting was about p.d. implying no copyright.


There is no date on the document; I just got it last month, so
it shouldn't be too old

>[Copyright by default, no notice needed etc.]

>So it seems that the default in both the US and Europe is that new
>works are copyright by default and copyright notices are unneccessary.

That's actually a relief to know; all the old (1990) rubbish I gave
people is copyright..

I've included the article at the end of this. I hope it isn't
infringing copyright 8-)

Anyway, thanx a lot for the letter. It is very useful to know;
I've included a summary at the top of the article, when sending
it to others who have asked.

     I am an attorney practicing copyright law and computer  law.
I  read  a series of queries in net.legal about copyright law and
was dismayed to find that people who had no idea what  they  were
talking  about  were  spreading  misinformation over the network.
Considering that the penalties for copyright infringement can in-
clude  $50,000.00  damages  per  infringed  work, attorneys fees,
court costs, criminal fines  and  imprisonment,  and  considering
that  ignorance  is  no  excuse and innocent intent is not even a
recognized defense, I cringe to see the network used as a soapbox
for the ill-informed.  For that reason, this article will discuss
copyright law  and  license  law  as  they  pertain  to  computer
software.

     My goal is to enable readers to determine when  they  should
be  concerned  about infringing and when they can relax about it.
I also want to let programmers know how to obtain  copyright  for
their  work.   I'll explain the purpose of software licenses, and
discuss the effect that the license has on copyright.  For  those
of  you who are programmers, I'll help you decide whether you own
the programs you write on the job or your boss owns them.  I will
also  mention  trademark  law and patent law briefly, in order to
clarify some confusion about which is  which.   Incidentally,  if
you read this entire essay, you will be able to determine whether
or not the essay is copyrighted and whether or not you can make a
printout of it.

     This is a long article, and you may not want to read all  of
it.   Here is an outline to help you decide what to read and what

1.  The Meaning of Copyright from the Viewpoint of  the  Software
User

1.1.  A bit of history

     If you're not interested in history, you can skip this para-
graph.   Modern  copyright law first came into existence in 1570,
by an act of Parliament called the Statute of  Anne.   Like  most
laws,  it  hasn't  changed much since.  It was written with books
and pictures in  mind.   Parliament,  lacking  the  foresight  to
predict  the success of the Intel and IBM corporations, failed to
consider the issue of copyrighting computer programs.

     At first, courts questioned whether programs could be  copy-
righted  at  all.   The problem was that judges couldn't read the
programs and they figured the Copyright Law was only meant to ap-
ply  to things humans (which arguably includes judges) could read
without the aid of a machine.  I  saw  some  mythical  discussion
about  that  in  some of the net.legal drivel.  Let's lay that to
rest:  programs are copyrightable as long  as  there  is  even  a
minimal  amount  of  creativity.  The issue was laid to rest with
the Software Act of 1980.  That Act modified  the  Copyright  Act
(which  is a Federal law by the way), in such a way as to make it
clear that programs are copyrightable.   The  few  exceptions  to
this rule will rarely concern anyone.  The next question to arise
was whether a program was copyrightable if it was stored  in  ROM
rather  than  on  paper.    The decision in the Apple v. Franklin
case laid that to rest:  it is.

1.2.  The meaning of copyright

     Now, what is copyright?  As it is commonly understood, it is
the  right  to make copies of something -- or to put it the other
way around, it is the right to prohibit other people from  making
copies.   This  is  known  as an exclusive right -- the exclusive
right to reproduce, in the biological language of  the  Copyright
Act -- and what most people don't know is that copyright involves
not one, not two, but five exclusive rights. These  are  (1)  the
exclusive  right  to make copies, (2) the exclusive right to dis-
tribute copies to the public, (3) the exclusive right to  prepare
derivative  works  (I'll explain, just keep reading), (4) the ex-
clusive right to perform the work in public (this mainly  applies
to  plays,  dances and the like, but it could apply to software),
and (5) the exclusive right to display the work in  public  (such
as showing a film).

1.3.  The meaning of public domain

     Before we go any further, what is public domain?  I saw some
discussion  on  the  net about public domain software being copy-
righted.  Nonsense.  The phrase public domain, when used correct-
ly,  means the absence of copyright protection.  It means you can
copy public domain software to your heart's  content.   It  means
that  the  author  has none of the exclusive rights listed above.
If someone uses the phrase public domain  to  refer  to  freeware
(software which is copyrighted but is distributed without advance
payment but with a request for a donation), he or  she  is  using
the term incorrectly.  Public domain means no copyright -- no ex-
clusive rights.

1.4.  A hypothetical software purchase

     Let's look at those exclusive rights from the  viewpoint  of
someone  who  has legitimately purchased a single copy of a copy-
righted computer program.  For the moment, we'll have  to  ignore
the  fact  that  the  program is supposedly licensed, because the
license changes things.  I'll explain that later.  For  now,  as-
sume  you  went  to  Fred's  Diner and Software Mart and bought a
dozen eggs, cat food and a word processing program.  And for now,
assume the program is copyrighted.

1.5.  Can you use copyrighted software?

     What can you do with this copyrighted software?  Let's start
with  the obvious:  can you use it on your powerful Timex PC?  Is
this a joke?  No.  Prior to 1980, my answer might have  been  No,
you can't use it!

     People actually pay me for advice like  that!   Well  think:
you  take the floppy disk out of the zip lock baggy, insert it in
drive A and load the program into RAM.  What have you just  done?
You've  made  a copy in RAM -- in legalese, you've reproduced the
work, in violation of the copyright owner's  exclusive  right  to
reproduce.  (I better clarify something here:  the copyright own-
er is the person or company whose name appears in  the  copyright
notice  on  the box, or the disk or the first screen or wherever.
It may be the person who wrote the program,  or  it  may  be  his
boss, or it may be a publishing company that bought the rights to
the program.  But in any case, it's not you. When you buy a  copy
of  the program, you do not become the copyright owner.  You just
own one copy.)

     Anyway, loading the program into RAM means  making  a  copy.
The Software Act of 1980 addressed this absurdity by allowing you
to make a copy if the copy "is created as an  essential  step  in
the  utilization  of  the  computer program in conjunction with a
machine and ...  is used in no other manner ...."   By  the  way,
somebody  tell me what a machine means.  If you connect 5 PC's on
a network is that a machine or several machines?  A related ques-
tion  is whether or not running software on a network constitutes
a performance.  The copyright owner has the exclusive right to do
that, remember?

1.6.  Can you make a backup copy?

     OK, so you bought this copyrighted program and you loaded it
into  RAM  or  onto  a hard disk without the FBI knocking on your
door.  Now can you make a backup copy?  YES.   The  Software  Act
also  provided  that you can make a backup copy, provided that it
"is for archival purposes only ...."  What you cannot do,  howev-
er,  is give the archive copy to your friend so that you and your
pal both got the program for the price of one.  That violates the
copyright  owner's  exclusive  right  to distribute copies to the
public.  Get it?  You can, on the other hand, give both your ori-
ginal  and backup to your friend -- or sell it to him, or lend it
to him, as long as you don't retain a copy of the program you are
selling.  Although the copyright owner has the exclusive right to
distribute (sell) copies of the program, that right only  applies
to the first sale of any particular copy.  By analogy, if you buy
a copyrighted book, you are free to sell your book to  a  friend.
The copyright owner does not have the right to control resales.

1.7.  Licenses may change the rules

     At this point, let me remind you that we have  assumed  that
the program you got at the store was sold to you, not licensed to
you.  Licenses may change the rules.

1.8.  Can you modify the program?

     Now, you're a clever programmer, and you  know  the  program
could  run  faster  with  some  modifications. You could also add
graphics and an interactive mode and lots of other  stuff.   What
does  copyright  law say about your plans?  Well ... several dif-
ferent things, actually.  First, recall that the copyright  owner
has  the  exclusive right to make derivative works.  A derivative
work is a work based on one or more preexisting works.  It's easy
to  recognize  derivative  works  when  you  think about music or
books.  If a book is copyrighted, derivative works could  include
a  screenplay, an abridged edition, or a translation into another
language.  Derivative works of songs might  be  new  arrangements
(like  the  jazz  version  of  Love  Potion  Number  9),  a movie
soundtrack, or a written transcription, or a long version,  (such
as the fifteen minute version of "Wipe Out" with an extended drum
solo for dance parties).  In my opinion, you are making a deriva-
tive work when you take the store-bought word processor and modi-
fy it to perform differently.  The same  would  be  true  if  you
translated  a  COBOL program into BASIC.  Those are copyright in-
fringements -- you've horned in  on  the  copyright  owner's  ex-
clusive  right to make derivative works.  There is, however, some
breathing room.  The Software Act generously allows you to  adapt
the  code  if  the adaptation "is created as an essential step in
the utilization of the computer program  in  conjunction  with  a
machine  ...."  For example, you might have to modify the code to
make it compatible with your machine.

1.9.  Can you break the copy protection scheme?

     Moving right along, let's assume your store  bought  program
is  copy  protected, and you'd really like to make a backup copy.
You  know  this  nine-year-old  whiz  who  can  crack  any  copy-
protection scheme faster than you can rearrange a Rubix cube.  Is
there a copyright violation if he succeeds?  There's room to  ar-
gue here. When you try to figure out if something is an infringe-
ment, ask yourself, what exclusive right am I violating?  In this
case,  not the right to make copies, and not the right to distri-
bute copies.  Public performance and display have  no  relevance.
So  the key question is whether you are making a derivative work.
My answer to that question is, "I doubt it."  On the other  hand,
I  also  doubt that breaking the protection scheme was "an essen-
tial step" in using the program in conjunction  with  a  machine.
It  might be a "fair use," but that will have to wait for another
article.  Anyone interested in stretching the limits of the "fair
use" defense should read the Sony Betamax case.

1.10.  Summary

     Let me summarize. Copyright means the  copyright  owner  has
the  exclusive right to do certain things. Copyright infringement
means you did one of those exclusive things (unless  you  did  it
within the limits of the Software Act, i.e., as an essential step
....).


2.  Copyright Sounds Neat -- How Do I Get One?  Or, How Do I Know
if this Program is Copyrighted?

2.1.  How do you get a copyright?

     If you've written an original program, what do you  have  to
do to get a copyright? Nothing. You already have one.

2.2.  How do you lose a copyright?

     If you've written an original program, what do you  have  to
do  to  lose your copyright protection?  Give copies away without
the copyright notice.

2.3.  How do you waste a stamp?

     If you mail the program to yourself in  a  sealed  envelope,
what have you accomplished? You've wasted a stamp and an envelope
and burdened the postal system unnecessarily.

2.4.  Do you have to register?

     Do you have to register your program with the U.S. Copyright
Office?  No, but it's a damn good idea.

2.5.  How copyright comes into existence

     Copyright protection (meaning  the  five  exclusive  rights)
comes  into existence the moment you fix your program in a tangi-
ble medium.  That means write it down, or store it  on  a  floppy
disk,  or  do  something similar.  Registration is optional.  The
one thing you must do, however, is protect your copyright by  in-
cluding  a  copyright  notice  on every copy of every program you
sell, give away, lend out, etc.  If you don't, someone  who  hap-
pens  across  your program with no notice on it can safely assume
that it is in the public domain (unless he actually knows that it
is not).

2.6.  The copyright notice

     The copyright notice has three parts.  The first can be  ei-
ther  a  c  with a circle around it (c), or the word Copyright or
the abbreviation Copr.  The c with a circle around it is  prefer-
able,  because  it is recognized around the world; the others are
not.  That's incredibly important.  Countries  around  the  world
have  agreed to recognize and uphold each others' copyrights, but
this world-wide protection requires the use of the c in a circle.
On  disk  labels and program packaging, use the encircled c.  Un-
fortunately, computers don't draw small circles well, so program-
mers  have  resorted  to a c in parentheses: (c).  Too bad.  That
has no legal meaning.  When you put your notice in the  code  and
on  the  screen, use Copyright or Copr.  if you can't make a cir-
cle.

     The second part of the notice is the "year of first publica-
tion  of  the work." Publication doesn't mean distribution by Os-
borne Publishing Co.  It means distribution of copies of the pro-
gram to the public "by sale or other transfer of ownership, or by
rental, lease, or lending."  So when you  start  handing  out  or
selling copies of your precious code, you are publishing.  Publi-
cation also takes place  when  you  merely  OFFER  to  distribute
copies to a group for further distribution.  Your notice must in-
clude the year that you first did so.

     The third part of the notice is the name of the owner of the
copyright.   Hopefully,  that's you, in which case your last name
will do.  If your company owns the program -- a legal issue which
I  will  address later in this article -- the company name is ap-
propriate.

     Where do you put the notice?  The general idea is to put  it
where  people  are likely to see it. Specifically, if you're dis-
tributing a human-readable code listing, put it on the first page
in  the  first few lines of code, and hard code it so that it ap-
pears on the title screen, or at sign-off, or  continuously.   If
you're distributing machine-readable versions only, hard code it.
As an extra precaution, you should also place the notice  on  the
gummed  disk  label or in some other fashion permanently attached
to the storage medium.

2.7.  Advantages of registration

     Now, why register the program?  If no one ever rips off your
program, you won't care much about registration.  If someone does
rip it off, you'll kick yourself for not  having  registered  it.
The  reason  is  that if the program is registered before the in-
fringement takes place, you can recover some big bucks  from  the
infringer,  called statutory damages, and the court can order the
infringer to pay your attorneys fees.   Registration  only  costs
$10.00,  and it's easy to do yourself.  The only potential disad-
vantage is the requirement that you deposit the first and last 25
pages  of  your  source  code,  which  can  be inspected (but not
copied) by members of the public.

2.8.  A test to see if you understand this article

     Now, someone tell me this:   is  this  article  copyrighted?
Can you print it?

3.  Who Owns The Program You Wrote?

3.1.  Introduction

     The starting point of this analysis is that if you wrote the
program, you are the author, and copyright belongs to the author.
HOWEVER, that can change instantly. There are two common ways for
your  ownership  to  shift  to someone else:  first, your program
might be a "work for hire."  Second, you  might  sell  or  assign
your  rights  in  the  program,  which for our purposes means the
copyright.

3.2.  Programs written as an employee

     Most of the programs which you write at work, if not all  of
them,  belong to your employer. That's because a program prepared
by an employee within the scope of his or  her  employment  is  a
"work for hire," and the employer is considered the author.  This
is more or less automatic if you are an employee  --  no  written
agreement is necessary to make your employer the copyright owner.
By contrast, if you can convince your employer to let you be  the
copyright owner, you must have that agreement in writing.

     By the way, before you give up hope of owning the  copyright
to the program you wrote at work, figure out if you are really an
employee.  That is actually a complex legal question, but  I  can
tell you now that just because your boss says you are an employee
doesn't mean that it's so.  And remember that if you created  the
program outside the scope of your job, the program is not a "work
for hire."  Finally, in California and  probably  elsewhere,  the
state  labor law provides that employees own products they create
on their own time, using their own tools and  materials.  Employ-
ment  contracts  which  attempt to make the employer the owner of
those off-the-job inventions are void, at least in sunny Califor-
nia.

3.3.  Programs written as a contractor

     Wait a minute:  I'm an independent contractor to Company  X,
not an employee.  I come and go as I please, get paid by the hour
with no tax withheld, and was retained  to  complete  a  specific
project.   I  frequently  work at home with my own equipment.  Is
the program I'm writing a "work for hire," owned by the  Company?
Maybe,  maybe not.  In California, this area is full of landmines
for employers, and gold for contractors.

     A contractor's program is not a "work for hire," and is  not
owned  by  the  company,  unless (1) there is a written agreement
between the company and the contractor which says that it is, and
(2)  the work is a commissioned work.  A commissioned work is one
of the following:  (a)  a contribution to a collective work,  (b)
an  audiovisual work (like a movie, and maybe like a video game),
(c) a translation, (d) a compilation, (e) an instructional  text,
(f) a test or answer to a test, or (g) an atlas.  I know you must
be tired of definitions, but this is what the real legal world is
made  of.   An example of a  collective work is a book of poetry,
with poems contributed by various authors.  A piece of code which
is  incorporated  into  a large program isn't a contribution to a
collective work, but a stand-alone program which is packaged  and
sold with other stand-alone programs could be.

     So where are we?  If you are a contract programmer,  not  an
employee, and your program is a commissioned work, and you have a
written agreement that says that the program is a "work for hire"
owned by the greedy company, who owns the program?  That's right,
the company.  But guess what?  In California  and  elsewhere  the
company  just  became your employer!  This means that the company
must now provide worker's compensation benefits for you AND UNEM-
PLOYMENT INSURANCE.

4.  A Brief Word About Licenses.

4.1.  Why a license?

     When you get software  at  the  local  five  and  dime,  the
manufacturer  claims  that you have a license to use that copy of
the program.  The reason for this is that the manufacturer  wants
to  place more restrictions on your use of the program than copy-
right law places.  For example, licenses typically  say  you  can
only  use the program on a single designated CPU.  Nothing in the
copyright law says that.  Some licenses say you  cannot  make  an
archive  copy.  The copyright law says you can, remember?  But if
the license is a valid license, now you can't.  You can  sell  or
give  away  your  copy  of  a program if you purchased it, right?
That's permitted by copyright law, but the license  may  prohibit
it.  The more restrictive terms of the license will apply instead
of the more liberal copyright rules.

4.2.  Is it valid?

     Is the license valid?  This is hotly debated among  lawyers.
(What  isn't?   We'll argue about the time of day.)  A few states
have passed or will soon pass laws declaring that they are valid.
A  few  will  go the other way.  Federal legislation is unlikely.
My argument is that at the consumer level,  the  license  is  not
binding  because there is no true negotiation (unless a state law
says it is binding), but hey that's just an argument and I'm  not
saying  that  that's  the  law.   In any case, I think businesses
which buy software will be treated differently in court than con-
sumers.  Businesses should read those licenses and negotiate with
the manufacturer if the terms are unacceptable.

5.  I Have A Neat Idea. Can I Trademark It?  What About patent?

5.1.  Trademark law explained

     Sorry, no luck.  Trademark law  protects  names:   names  of
products  and  names of services.  (Note that I did not say names
of companies.  Company names are not trademarkable.)  If you  buy
a program that has a trademarked name, all that means is that you
can't sell your own similar program under the same name.  It  has
nothing to do with copying the program.

5.2.  Patent Law

     Patent law can apply to computer  programs,  but  it  seldom
does.   The  main  reasons  it seldom applies are practical:  the
patent process is too slow and too expensive to do much  good  in
the software world.  There are also considerable legal hurdles to
overcome in order to obtain a patent.  If, by chance,  a  program
is  patented,  the  patent owner has the exclusive right to make,
use or sell it for 17 years.

6.  CONCLUSION

     I know this is a long article, but believe it or not I  just
scratched  the  surface.  Hopefully, you'll find this information
useful, and you'll stop passing along myths about copyright  law.
If anyone needs more information, I can be reached at the address
on the first page.  Sorry, but I do not usually  have  access  to
the network, so you can't reach me there.

Thank you.  JORDAN J. BRESLOW

I also checked in the misc.legal newsgroup and found:

So it seems that the default in both the US and Europe is that new
