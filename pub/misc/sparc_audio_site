Hello.

Can anyone help ? There is a sounds archive based in USA (sounds.sdsu.edu)
which as hundreds of sound samples which I would like to play on my ARC.
However they are sun format (.au) and so come out as a load of rubbish
at the moment as I am using !Fplay to play them straight from hard disk.

Does anyone know what program can convert them to a format that I can
use ??

Thanks, Stuart ++++++++++++++++++++++++
