                          MULTIPLICATION DUE TO SMARANDACHE


     
     Another algorithm to multiply two integer numbers, A and B:
       - let k be an integer >= 2;
       - write A and B on two different vertical columns: c(A), respectively 
           c(B);
       - multiply A by k, and write the product A  on the column c(A);
                                                 1
       - divide B by k, and write the integer part of the quotient B
                                                                    1 
           on the column c(B);
       ... and so on with the new numbers A  and  B , 
                                           1       1
       untill we get a B  < k on the column c(B);
                        i
       Then:
       - write another column c(r), on the right side of c(B), such that:
           for each number of column c(B), which may be a multiple of k plus 
           the rest r (where r = 0, 1, 2, ..., k-1),
           the corresponding number on c(r) will be r;
       - multiply each number of column A by its corresponding r of c(r),
           and put the new products on another column c(P) on the right side 
           of c(r);
       - finally add all numbers of column c(P).
       AxB = the sum of all numbers of c(P).

      Remark that any multiplication of integer numbers can be done 
        only by multiplication with 2, 3, ..., k, divisions by k, and additions.


   This is a generalization of Russian multiplication (when k=2).

   Smarandache multiplication is usefull when k is very small, the best values
   being for k=2 (Russian multiplication -- known since Egyptian time), or k=3. 
   If k is greater than or equal to min {10, B}, this multiplication is trivial
   (the obvious multiplication).


   Example 1 (if we choose k=3):
      73x97= ? 

                                     x3  |  /3  |           
                                  -------|------|-------------
                                    c(A) | c(B) | c(r) | c(P)
                                  -------|------|------|------
                                     73  |  97  |   1  |   73 
                                    219  |  32  |   2  |  438
                                    657  |  10  |   1  |  657
                                   1971  |   3  |   0  |    0
                                   5913  |   1  |   1  | 5913
                                  ---------------------|------
                                                       | 7081 total

      therefore: 73x97=7081.
      Remark that any multiplication of integer numbers can be done
        only by multiplication with 2, 3, divisions by 3, and additions.



   Example 2 (if we choose k=4):
      73x97= ? 

                                     x4  |  /4  |           
                                  -------|------|-------------
                                    c(A) | c(B) | c(r) | c(P)
                                  -------|------|------|------
                                     73  |  97  |   1  |   73 
                                    292  |  24  |   0  |    0
                                   1168  |   6  |   2  | 2336
                                   4672  |   1  |   1  | 4672
                                  ---------------------|------
                                                       | 7081 total

      therefore: 73x97=7081.
      Remark that any multiplication of integer numbers can be done
        only by multiplication with 2, 3, 4, divisions by 4, and additions.



   Example 3 (if we choose k=5):
      73x97= ? 

                                     x5  |  /5  |           
                                  -------|------|-------------
                                    c(A) | c(B) | c(r) | c(P)
                                  -------|------|------|------
                                     73  |  97  |   2  |  146 
                                    365  |  19  |   4  | 1460
                                   1825  |   3  |   3  | 5475
                                  ---------------------|------
                                                       | 7081 total

      therefore: 73x97=7081.
      Remark that any multiplication of integer numbers can be done
        only by multiplication with 2, 3, 4, 5, divisions by 5, and additions.
 
    The Smarandache multiplication becomes less usefull when k increases.
    Look at another example (4), what happens when k=10:
      73x97= ? 

                                    x10  | /10  |           
                                  -------|------|-------------
                                    c(A) | c(B) | c(r) | c(P)
                                  -------|------|------|------
                                     73  |  97  |   7  |  511 (=73x7)   
                                    730  |   9  |   9  | 6570 (=730x9)
                                  ---------------------|------
                                                       | 7081 total

      therefore: 73x97=7081.
      Remark that any multiplication of integer numbers can be done
        only by multiplication with 2, 3, ..., 9, 10, divisions by 10, and 
        additions --
        hence we obtain just the obvious multiplication!

                       DIVISION BY k^n DUE TO SMARANDACHE




     Another algorithm to divide an integer numbers A by k^n, where k, n are 
     integers >= 2:
       - write A and k^n on two different vertical columns: c(A), respectively 
           c(k^n);
       - divide A by k, and write the integer quotient A  on the column c(A);
                                                        1
       - divide k^n by k, and write the quotient q  = k^(n-1)
                                                  1
           on the column c(k^n);

       ... and so on with the new numbers A  and  q , 
                                           1       1
       untill we get q  = 1 (= k^0) on the column c(k^n);
                      n
       Then:
       - write another column c(r), on the left side of c(A), such that:
           for each number of column c(A), which may be a multiple of k plus 
           the remainder r (where r = 0, 1, 2, ..., k-1),
           the corresponding number on c(r) will be r;
       - write another column c(P), on the left side of c(r), in the following
           way: the element on line i (except the last line which is 0) will 
           be k^(i-1);
       - multiply each number of column c(P) by its corresponding r of c(r),
           and put the new products on another column c(R) on the left side 
           of c(P);
       - finally add all numbers of column c(R) to get the final remainder R ,
                                                                            n
         while the final quotient will be stated in front of c(k^n)'s 1.
       Therefore:
          A/(k^n) = A  and remainder R .
                     n                n

      Remark that any division of an integer number by k^n can be done 
        only by divisions to k, calculations of powers of k, 
        multiplications with 1, 2, ..., k-1, additions.


   Smarandache division is usefull when k is small, the best values being when
   k is an one-digit number, and n large. 
   If k is very big and n verry small, this division becomes useless.


   Example 1 :
     1357/(2^7) = ?


                                         |  /2  |   /2   |
                    ---------------------|------|--------|
                    | c(R) | c(P) | c(r) | c(A) | c(2^7) |
                    |------|------|------|------|--------|
                    |   1  | 2^0  |   1  | 1357 |   2^7  |   line_1
                    |   0  | 2^1  |   0  |  678 |   2^6  |   line_2
                    |   4  | 2^2  |   1  |  339 |   2^5  |   line_3
                    |   8  | 2^3  |   1  |  169 |   2^4  |   line_4
                    |   0  | 2^4  |   0  |   84 |   2^3  |   line_5
                    |   0  | 2^5  |   0  |   42 |   2^2  |   line_6
                    |  64  | 2^6  |   1  |   21 |   2^1  |   line_7
                    |      |      |      --------        |
                    |      |      |      |   10 |   2^0  |   last_line
                    |------|-------------|------|---------
                    |  77  |             


       Therefore:  1357/(2^7) = 10 and remainder 77. 
           


      Remark that the division of an integer number by any power of 2 can be 
        done only by divisions to 2, calculations of powers of 2, 
        multiplications and additions.



   Example 2 :
     19495/(3^8) = ?


                                         |  /3   |   /3   |

                    |  486 | 3^5  |   2  |    80 |   3^3  |   line_6
                    | 1458 | 3^6  |   2  |    26 |   3^2  |   line_7
                    | 4374 | 3^7  |   2  |     8 |   3^1  |   line_8
                    |      |      |      ---------        |
                    |      |      |      |     2 |   3^0  |   last_line
                    |------|-------------|-------|---------
                    | 6373 |             


       Therefore:  19495/(3^8) = 2 and remainder 6373. 
           

      Remark that the division of an integer number by any power of 3 can be 
        done only by divisions to 3, calculations of powers of 3, 
        multiplications and additions.

                A SMARANDACHE GENERALIZATION OF EULER'S THEOREM


          Let a, m be integers, m different from 0.  Then:

     phi(m ) + s
          s                        s
    a             is congruent to a   (mod m),

    where phi(x) is Euler's Totient Function,

    and s and m  are obtained through the algorithm:
               s

       ___
      |    a = a d      ;  (a , m ) = 1;
      |         0 0          0   0
  (0) |
      |    m = m d      ;   d  different from 1;
      |         0 0          0
       ---

       ___       1            1

Therefore it is not necessary for a and m to be coprime.

Example:   6      is congruent to ? (mod 105765).
           It is not possible to use Fermat's or Euler's theorems,
           but the Smarandache Congruence Theorem works:

           d  = (6, 105765) = 3   
            0
           m  = 105765/3 = 35255
            0
           i = 0
           3 is different from 1


           thus i = 0+1 = 1
           d  = (3, 35255) = 1
            1
           m  = 35255/1 = 35255.
            1
                      phi(35255)+1                  1
           therefore 6             is congruent to 6  (mod 105765)

                   25604               4
           whence 6      is congruent 6  (mod 105765).
