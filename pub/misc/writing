Whom
====
The object form of "who".  E.g. "The woman whom I married".  "The man
to whom I gave the money".  Almost never used as the first word of a
sentence (even where this is technically correct).  (Mnemonic: if the
answer is "he", use "who", if the answer is "him", use "whom").


Hyphen
======
Hyphenate compound words (two words being joined to create a new,
single word), e.g. "on-line".

Don't hyphenate prefixes ("rewrite", not "re-write") except between
vowels ("re-install").

"e-mail" not "email".

Use to indicate adjective associativity, e.g. "bold-faced type" - the
face of the type is bold, not a kind of "faced type" - but don't use
after adverb ending in "-ly", e.g. "doubly linked list.

Use between number and unit when used together as an adjective,
e.g. "a ten-foot pole".

-ly
===
Generally, just add "ly" to the adjective after dropping any final
"le", e.g. singly, doubly, but note: solely, wholly.

Depend
======
My only dependant (n.) is dependent (adj.) on me.  The Independent
(adj.) newspaper is proud of its independence.


William Safire's Rules for Writers
==================================
Remember to never split an infinitive.  The passive voice should never
be used.  Do not put statements in the negative form.  Verbs have to
agree with their subjects.  Proofread carefully to see if you words
out.  If you reread your work, you can find on rereading a great deal
of repetition can be avoided by rereading and editing.  A writer must
not shift your point of view.  And don't start a sentence with a
conjunction.  (Remember, too, a preposition is a terrible word to end a
sentence with.)  Don't overuse exclamation marks!!  Place pronouns as
close as possible, especially in long sentences, as of 10 or more
words, to their antecedents.  Writing carefully, dangling participles
must be avoided.  If any word is improper at the end of a sentence, a
linking verb is.  Take the bull by the hand and avoid mixing
metaphors.  Avoid trendy locutions that sound flaky.  Everyone should
be careful to use a singular pronoun with singular nouns in their
writing.  Always pick on the correct idiom.  The adverb always follows
the verb.  Last but not least, avoid cliches like the plague; seek
viable alternatives.


Writing papers
==============
What is the problem?
Why is the problem important?
What is the original contribution of this work?
Does it check/extend previous work? What work? (Give references)
Give sufficient information in summary
Are the results significant?


-ise/-ize
=========
Both spellings are correct in British English.

Oxford University Press, Cambridge University Press, Fowler's Modern
English Usage and American usage all favour "-ize", which is
etymologically and phonetically more correct (for words derived from
Greek words ending "-izein").

"-Ise" is a more recent version inherited from French and is much more
common.  It is the convention in most British book and newspaper
publishing.  The Times converted overnight in the mid-1980s, at about
the time two new broadsheets were founded (The Independent and The
European), which have used -ise from the beginning.

Using "-ise" avoids the need to learn the approximately 40 words, such
as "advise", that are always spelled with "-ise", though these are
mostly words which are not some root plus "-ise".

Full stop
=========
If a sentence ends with an abbreviation that is normally written with
a full stop, e.g. "etc.", don't add another full stop.
