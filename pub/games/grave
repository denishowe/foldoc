Here's a challenging puzzle I saw on soc.roots yesterday:

	A tombstone on a family grave reads

	Two grandmothers and their two granddaughters,
	Two mothers and their two sons,
	Two fathers and their two wives,
	Two sisters and their two brothers,
	But only six corpses lie buried here,
	All legitimate and free of incest clear.

To be fair, in the solution I've seen, the sisters are not sisters of
each other (in fact they are each other's half-aunts), nor are the
brothers brothers of each other (but they are step-fathers of each
other) and each sister is only a half-sister of a half-brother.
