I used to drive the AUX input on my Creek amp from the Arc headphone
output and had no problem. As for impedance matching, transmission lines
were never a strong point of mine.

I think the problem here is that since the speaker in the Arc is so poor
at the low end it gives the impression of having a better response than
your stereo at the high end. Also, I do know that the headphone output
first passes through a low-pass filter to remove any unwanted high
frequency components caused by the digital to analogue conversion.
Unfortunately the filter may be a bit severe hence the dull sound. I don't
know if the sound for the internal speaker is passed through this filter.

It is, however, possible to bypass this filter. Inside the Arc (400 series
at least) there is a 2x5 array of pins near the headphone socket which
provides an unfiltered audio output. I now feed this signal to my amp
which gives a much better sound, most of the time. Sometimes a bit of
high frequency noise is noticable. I can find out the exact pin numbers
if you want.

I'm confused now, are you using a sensitive phono input or a normal line
level input. I wouldn't even think about using any phono input. You should
be able to use a tape,tuner,CD or Aux input with no problems. That is
unless your amp has very low overload margins on those inputs.

Well I'm not an engineer, so I accept no responsibility for whatever happens
to you or your machine if you do the following (I imagine it will void your
warrantee too, if you still have one), but...

The Problem:
> I have my Arc connected to the auxilliary inputs on the stereo.

The Symptom:
> The high end of the Arc sound seems to get lost in the translation

The Cause:
Low Pass filter present.

The Solution:
Tap sound output before it reaches the Low Pass filter.

The Method:

- Open your 300, 400(/1), 500, or 5000 series machine up, and find a 5x2 pin
  connector somewhere in the video circuitry. There's only one, and on the
  310's I have seen it is near the back-right corner of the circuit board.
  On the 5000 it is around the back-center of the board I think (it's the
  only such connector that I can see on the board). It looks something like:

    9 . .
      . .
      . .
      . .
    1 . .

- All the pins on the right (even numbered ones) are ground. Pin 1 is LEFT
  sound output and pin 9 is RIGHT sound output. I have no proof but guess
  that pins 3, 5, and 7 are raw R, G, and B video signals respectively.

- Attach a 3.5" socket to a short length of ribbon cable and clamp a 5x2 IDC
  plug on the other end. (Much better than soldering wires directly to the
  pins). I use pin 8 for ground but in theory any even numbered one will do)
  I assume you know the layout of a 3.5" socket 'cos I can't for the life of
  me remember it at the moment! It's in the User Guide in one of the
  appendices anyway...

- Dangle the socket out the back through one of the cracks (if there are
  any...) or better still, drill a new hole in the bottom back panel right
  next to the current headphone socket hole and mount the new 3.5" socket in
  it. You now have TWO output sockets, one filtered, one unfiltered.

- Attach your stereo to the new socket, which works equally well as a
  headphone socket or a line out.

I find that without the filter STMs sound much better, but low grade samples sound a lot more scratchy. This is understandable, as STMs are played at
29KHz, while low grade samples are less than 20KHz, usually 13 or 10KHz.

Apparently the filter is there to make the sound from the internal speaker
sound reasonable. Shame it also affects the standard external connector,
otherwise all this hacking around wouldn't be necessary.

This "upgrade" is also possible on the A3000, but you have to hook into a
couple of resister legs (I don't know which ones sorry) as the 3000 doesn't
have the 5x2 connector on the circuit board.

    Cheers, Julian.
