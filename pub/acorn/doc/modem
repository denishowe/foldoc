We've been having exactly the same problems (on both an A5000 and a RISC
PC), which were solved by rewiring the serial cable according to a wacky
scheme courtesy of Dean Murphy at Acorn customer services:
 Acorn 9-pin end           25-way D end
  1                          20
  2                          3
  3                          2
  4                          20
  5                          7
  6                          5
  7                          4
  8                          20
  9                          8

Apparently it's due to the drivers expecting the old serial chips which had
faults which the serial drivers had to get round.

I suspect that you can get proper/newer drivers which understand a proper PC
serial cable, and I would be grateful to hear from anyone who knows this to
be true.

Tony.

Obviously the modem is connected to the A5000 via a standard PC cable. This is
OK on an A5000, but you have to tell ArcTerm. There are two different block
drivers for the internal serial port, one which exspects a standard PC cable,
the other one suitable for the adapted cable needed for older Archies.

Ensure the driver is set for a Miracom HST plus
(This works perfectly with the Sportster)
