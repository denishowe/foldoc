Vincent R.B. Blazy <vrb.blazy@orange.fr>,HeadNormalForm,"I am sorry to guess that, instead of ""not reducible"" (resp. ""a reducible""), you actually mean ""not head reducible"" (resp. ""a head reducible""); otherwise your lambda abstractions that are H.N.F.s are automatically N.F.s, excluding every other lambda abstractions whose body is reducible but in H.N.F. of any form."

Mike Housky <mike@housky.net>,IBM2741,"Calling the 2741 ""slow"" is anachronistic.  It was about 50% faster than the Teletype devices it competed with, averaging about 15 characters per second compared to 10 CPS for a Teletype.  Also, 20 years product lifetime is a bit of a stretch.  It may have been available for that long, but by the mid '70s there was competition from daisy-wheel printing terminals,  which also supported custom type elements, but printed about twice as fast as the 2741."
