Attached is my walkthrough for the Macintosh version of Lemmings. It's
not finished, and might not ever be finished, because I have a job.
What's missing are hints for most of the levels, and solutions to most
of the challenges. If you feel like writing any of these, please send
me a copy and I'll paste it in (with full attribution, of course). If
you're completely stuck on any of the challenges, drop me a line and
I'll try to help you out.

A Lemmings Walkthrough
======================

By Ephraim Vishniac (ephraim@think.com) and Frank O'Neil (frank@cetia.fr).
I (Ephraim) did the writing. Frank contributed some ideas that I hadn't
thought of, and inspired me to find many tricky solutions. There's nothing
like a little competition to get your brain working.

This is version 0.2, last updated September 2, 1993.

This document is wrapped as an setext. You can read it as-is, or browse it
in an setext viewer such as Akif Eyler's Easy View(tm).

This walkthrough aims to tell you everything needed to finish every level
of Lemmings in the most effective way possible. Since it would spoil your
fun if we gave the answers straight out, the chapters of this walkthrough
are arranged progressively. You can get a hint when you need one, or a full
solution if you're really stuck.

Don't read past chapter 1 unless you're desperate! It's much more
satisfying to discover things on your own. "...for the getting of wisdom is
no match for the thrill of the chase, and those who choose the longer road
will reap their reward." -- Graeme Base.

_The Levels_ simply lists the levels and their attributes, including each
level's password. These are handy if you want to skip a level and come back
to it later. The passwords are especially handy if you have a
black-and-white machine, because Mayhem 14 (Pea Soup) is unplayable in that
case.

_General Skills_ describes some basic Lemming-management skills. Consider
these as hints for all levels.

_Hints_ and _Solutions_ give hints and solutions, respectively, for all the
levels. The solutions given are only adequate, not optimal.

_Challenges_ lists the best results that we've been able to achieve, often
far above what's required. It appears that many of these challenges were
constructed deliberately by the game's designers. _Challenge Hints_ and
_Challenge Solutions_ give hints and solutions for these challenges.

A few of the Lemmings levels could be played quite differently if only they
came with a different collection of lemmings. _Challenges Requiring
Patches_ describes a few of these, but you'll need to modify your copy of
Lemmings to actually play them. _Patching Lemmings_ explains how to patch
Lemmings on various platforms.

1. The Levels
=============

The following tables summarize all the levels of Lemmings and the two demo
versions. **Rate** is the rate at which lemmings initially enter.
**Lemmings** and **Goal** are the total population and the number to be
saved. **Minutes** is the time limit. The remaining items are the number of
instances of each lemming activity available, in the same order in which
they appear on the screen.

1.7 Credits
-----------

The titles and statistics for the various levels were automatically
extracted from the Macintosh version of Lemmings by ephraim@think.com on 22
January 1993.

The passwords were reported by "DTF" in a document archived as
codes.lemmings.newer dated 92-12-29. That document also includes the
following explanation of the passwords:

   For the curious, here is a description of the Lemmings codes:

   Code elements: 0123456789

   0       (unknown)
   123456  % of lemmings saved in previous level
   78      game level
   9       checksum

   The checksum character is found using this equation (where code(N) is the
   ASCII value of the character at position N):

       code(9) = 74 + (sum(code(0)..code(8)) modulus 16)

2. General Skills
=================

Many lemmings maneuvers are used repeatedly. Rather than explain these
every time they come up, we've collected them here.

2.1 Turning a Walker or Walker/Climber
--------------------------------------

A lemming who is walking will stop and turn around when he meets a barrier.
For a walker, this is anything to steep to climb. If you want to turn
lemming where there's no barrier, dig a shallow hole, then build. The hole
must be deep enough that the builder will be frustrated and turn back, but
not so deep that he can't climb out the other side.

Alternatively, you can turn around a walker by making him bash or mine
toward a steel barrier. The advantage to this is that following lemmings
will also be turned around.

A lemming with climbing ability will only turn around when he meets an
overhang. To turn him around against a wall or slope, make him build so
that he meets the obstacle while building.

2.2 Turning a Builder
---------------------

When a builder meets most barriers, he stops building, turns around, and
walks away. When a builder meets a blocker, though, he turns and keeps
building.

2.3 Building Faster
-------------------

With careful timing, you can let another lemming step onto a just-laid
brick and start building. His bricks will stick out ahead of the original
builder's, and so the ramp will be extended just a little bit faster than
otherwise.

2.4 Floating Faster
-------------------

Falling is faster than floating. Lemmings slow instantly when converted to
floaters, so apply the parachute when the lemming is nearly at the ground.
Just don't miss, because there's no second chance.

2.5 Stretching a Ramp
---------------------

When a builder runs out of bricks, he pauses, shrugs, and then walks off
the last brick he laid. If you wait until he starts to walk before making
him build again, you gain a quarter or a half of a brick in horizontal
span. It takes some practice to do this consistently, so it's much safer to
make him build again while he's shrugging if you don't need the distance.

2.6 Releasing a Blocker
-----------------------

Unlike scenery and ramps, blockers fall and resume walking when you dig
underneath them.

3. Hints
========

These hints are deliberately vague, so as not to spoil your fun. If you
need a spoiler, go look at the _Solutions_ instead.

3.1 Fun Hints
-------------

Don't worry. The lemmings you lose by using the most straightforward
solutions are few enough that you'll still finish the levels. If you really
need to, use a blocker or two to bottle up stray lemmings until you're
ready for them. Notice that you can bomb a blocker, build over him, or dig
under him.

3.2 Tricky Hints
----------------

3. **A ladder would be handy** Instead of building up to the exit, how
about digging down from it?

3.3 Taxing Hints
----------------

3.4 Mayhem Hints
----------------

3.5 Demo Hints
--------------


4. Solutions
============

This section gives a minimal solution for each level. While many
refinements are possible (see the _Challenges_), these are the easiest or
most obvious solutions.

4.1 Fun Solutions
-----------------

1. **Just dig!** Do that.

2. **Only floaters can survive this** Make them all floaters.

3. **Tailor-made for blockers** Repeatedly make the leading lemming a
blocker, so that the following lemmings are turned away from excessive
falls.

4. **Now use miners and climbers** Dig down, climb up.

5. **You need bashers this time** Bash through the post, the rocks, and the
gridwork.

6. **A task for blockers and bombers** Make the first lemming a blocker
anywhere, then bomb him to dig through the upper level. Make the second
lemming a blocker at the post obstructing the exit, then bomb him to break
through the post.

7. **Builders will help you here** Build once to scale the first wall. Build
again to span the pit. Keep the following lemmings out of the pit by making
them build, too.

8. **Not as complicated as it looks** Make the first lemming a blocker. Bomb
him when you're done.

9. **As long as you try your best** Bash through the pillar. Make every
lemming a basher as they approach the "working surface", and none (or very
few) will turn around.

10. **Smile if you love lemmings** Make the first lemming a digger, and the
second one a floater. When the floater lands, block him. After the others
turn for the exit, bomb the blocker to get rid of him.

11. **Keep your hair on Mr. Lemming** The first lemming should be a
climber/floater ("athlete") to go over the one-way obstruction. Instead of
letting him out the exit, build over the exit so that he turns around at
the far wall. As he reaches the barrier, bash through it. The first lemming
arriving near the exit can bash, dig, or mine through the ramp.

12. **Patience** Bash through the barrier. Don't worry about the lemmings
that turn around and fall off to the left. (You can make the first one a
blocker if you're worried.) Build up from the pit to the exit.

13. **We all fall down** Make each lemming dig before he reaches the hole
made by his predecessor.

14. **Origins and Lemmings** Bash or mine through the first pillar. In the
first valley, build twice near the right-hand end to meet the second
pillar. Bash through it and clear across the horizontal section. Repeat in
the second valley.

15. **Don't let your eyes deceive you** One athlete (climber/floater) goes
over the pillars while the rest of the lemmings mill around. The athlete
builds over the gap and the broken staircase. The other lemmings bash
through the three pillars.

16. **Don't do anything too hasty** The first lemming builds a ramp from
the right-hand end of the entry platform up toward the exit. The second
lemming blocks the others from the ramp, while the third blocks them
falling off at the left. When the ramp is complete, bomb the right-hand
blocker. When the crowd disperses, bomb the left-hand blocker.

17. **Easy when you know how** Make the first lemming out (from the
right-most entrance) an athlete. After he's climbed up one brick, bash
through the next brick toward the exit. Meanwhile, the first lemming out
>from the left-most entrance should be a blocker to keep the others from
dropping over the left edge. Another left-entrance lemming should dig down
slightly, then bash toward the right so that all lemmings wind up in a
trench. As the leader approaches the exit, make him build into the last
step so that he turns around. Now, he builds again to make a landing ramp
for the others. When the ramp is finished, build near the right-hand end of
the trench to let the rest climb out and drop down.

18. **Let's block and blow** Block and bomb five lemmings to cut through
the five levels, avoiding the braziers. Be careful not to line up the
holes, or lemmings will fall too far and die.

19. **Take good care of my Lemmings** The second lemming digs down in the
mound with the "keyhole" in it, while the first goes on to build a ramp
toward the exit. When the ramp is complete, the lemmings trapped in the
keyhole bash toward the right to escape.

20. **We are now at LEMCON ONE** The low road: Build over the first gap,
then bash through each post. Build over the second gap. If a few lemmings
turn around or fall off the ends of the ramps, that's OK.

The high road: Lemming one blocks the right-hand end of the entry platform.
Lemming two builds up toward the left, while lemming three blocks the
others. The second lemming's ramp bounces off the post at the left, and
continues up to the floating stonework at the top of the screen. He bashes
across to the right. Equipped with a parachute, he digs down just crossing
over the exit, and builds toward the right, bounces off the pillar there,
and builds back toward the left. This will be a landing ramp for the rest
of the lemmings. Bomb the blocker holding back the crowd. As they drop onto
the landing ramp, dig a hole in it so they can reach the lower part and
continue to the exit.

21. **You Live and Lem** Bash into the thick barrier with bones embedded in
it. Near the bones, switch from bashing to mining so that the lemmings walk
down into the lower area. At the right-hand end of that space, bash
through. Make one lemming a climber so he can get over the tangling twigs
and build a ramp over the trap. When it's safe, bash the twigs.

Alternative solutions: Build across the gap instead of dropping down, then
bash or mine more twigs to get to the exit. Or, build up into the "ceiling"
and bash across that.

22. **A Beast of a level** Bash through the trees. The first lemming that
turns around becomes a blocker at the left to hold down your losses. After
bashing through all the trees, build up toward the exit and bash to reach
it. 

23. **I've lost that Lemming feeling** There are three different exits, two
visible at the left and one hidden at the right.

Lower left exit: Make the first lemming a blocker at the brink of the
central drop-off. The second lemming bashes toward the left from the top of
the first slanting brick. When he encounters a missing brick, he steps into
it and bashes again from the highest point he can walk to. As he nears the
pulsing torch, he should dig diagonally to stay well below it. After
bridging the bottomless gap, the leader again bashes left to reach the last
gap and then the exit. You can use a blocker to hold back the other
lemmings, but it's not necessary because you don't need to save very many.

Upper left exit: The first lemming is a blocker, as above. Instead of
bashing left, the second lemming builds toward the right from as far left
as possible. After the ramp passes under the entrance, bash a hole in it
with another lemming so that the builder is alone on the upper part of the
broken ramp. He builds up into the notch and builds again toward the left
after striking the right-hand wall. He needs to be quite high on the left
wall, so build back and forth between the walls once more. Bash to the left
until he's almost at the deep gap, then mine (or dig, then bash) to bring
him down a bit. Build across the gap and bash or mine through to the exit.
Repair the broken ramp to let the rest of the lemmings exit.

Lower right exit: Start out as for the upper left exit, but bash to the
right instead of the left. Bridge the bottomless gap, then bash, dig, and
mine through the bricks toward the large "X" under the EXIT sign at the far
right. (The two EXIT signs toward the left are red herrings -- they don't
mark exits.) Repair the broken ramp to let the rest of the lemmings follow
their leader.

24. **Konbanwa Lemming san** The first lemming digs once he's over the left
part of the middle platform. He digs again after dropping to the middle
platform, and once more as he comes over the exit platform. A few lemmings
will walk over the digger, but you don't need to save them all.

25. **Lemmings Lemmings everywhere** Mine your way through the gridwork
toward the spiderweb, about half-way up the side. (If you come in too high,
the lemmings will fall and die upon entering the web.) Dig, bash, or mine
your way to the exit. 

26. **Nightmare on Lem street** Both lemmings build across both gaps. There
are a hundred other possibilities, but that's the simplest.

27. **Let's be careful out there** Float the first lemming, then turn him
around just short of the exit by digging and building. As he steps out of
the little pit he turned in, have him build toward the left until he meets
an obstacle. Meanwhile, the other lemmings will start landing on the ramp
and going out the exit. If you care about the lemmings who fall too soon,
give them parachutes.

Alternatively, block the right-hand end of the entry platform and build a
ramp off its left-hand end. Block at the top of those steps and build
toward the right to reach the overhead platform. Use a blocker to keep
lemmings from falling off the right-hand edge after they drop down. Build
toward the left to reach the exit.

28. **If only they could fly** Make the first lemming an athlete after he
turns to the left. He'll climb off the top of the ladder and float to the
main platform. Dig down through the upper steps of the platform so the rest
of the lemmings gather on the lowest level. Stagger the holes so they don't
fall to far. Meanwhile, start the leader building up toward the exit from
just below the hanging lamp. When the ramp is done, release the rest of the
lemmings by bashing through the left side of the ladder. 

Alternatively, let all the lemmings off the first ladder. Put a blocker at
each end of the main platform. Use builders and blockers to build up from
level to level under the exit. Notice how a blocker can turn a builder
around.

29. **worra lorra lemmings** Block the right-hand end of the landing zone
with the first lemming. Bash toward the left repeatedly. Build up toward
the pyramid starting at the base of the block with stairs on each side.
(The right-hand stairs were intact until you bashed them; the left-hand
stairs have a break that you'll build through.) Bash left through the
pyramid starting at the small crevice on the right side. On exiting the
pyramid, build back and forth up to the exit.

30. **Lock up your Lemmings** Start the first lemming bashing. If he's
bashing toward the right, let him go to the end of the platform and build a
ramp to close it off. On his return, he should bash toward the left. Change
him to a digger when he's at the left edge of the column. When he's down
just below the second landing, make him mine or bash toward the left.

4.2 Tricky Solutions
--------------------

1. **This should be a doddle!** Build over the gap, bash through the
barrier. Don't worry about lemmings that fall down the hole.

2. **We all fall down** Just like Fun 13, but with more lemmings.

3. **A ladder would be handy** Dig. The second lemming will step over the
digger, so make him a floater. Change the digger to a miner so that he's
mining diagonally toward the valley. When the floater lands and walks over
to the gap, build across it. He'll walk to the far wall and turn around.
When he approaches the gap again, build again to meet the existing bridge.
Now the lemmings are safe from drowning. Make a climber. When he's nearly
at the exit, turn him around by digging and building. Immediately mine
toward the left to make a sloping tunnel for the other lemmings.

If you prefer, you can build your way out of the valley.

4. **Here's one I prepared earlier** Make the first lemming a climber so he
can ascend the one-way barrier. Let him climb over the bollard at the end
of the deck, then build bridges across the islands to the exit. Make
another climber from any lemming who's moving toward the right. After he
climbs the one-way barrier, turn him around by building against the
bollard. On his return trip toward the left, bash through the one-way
barrier to liberate the rest of the lemmings.

5. **Careless clicking costs lives** Bash through the first string, then
build to close the gap between the first two balls. At least one lemming
will fall into the gap; use him to bash toward the right through the
remaining balls. Build up from the end of the grid to the exit. When it's
safe, bash the second string to let the rest of the lemmings through.

6. **Lemmingology** Make the first lemming an athlete. Have him build as
needed to reach successsive platforms. Make the rest athletes and let them
follow.

7. **Been there, seen it, done it** Block off the right-hand edge of the
landing pillar. Build up toward the next pillar. Build again toward the
third one. Plant a blocker on the second pillar so that not too many
lemmings fall in the water. Build up from pillar to pillar until the last
one. Dig down in the last one, putting a jog in your tunnel so that the
lemmings don't fall too far. Build across to the exit platform. Bomb the
blocker. 

8. **Lemming sanctuary in sight** Build across the gap. Use any returning
lemming to build up from the opposite side to close off the gap. Build up
>from level to level until you reach the exit.

9. **They just keep on coming** Right-handed: The first lemming is a
climber, but needn't be a floater. He climbs out of the pit and over the
end, falling safely onto the mound at right. He should dig down in the
little valley between the peaks while the other lemmings are starting to
build their way out of the hole they're stuck in. The leader should mine
toward the left, but he needs to turn around first. You can either make him
build after he's dug down a ways, or let him mine toward the right until he
strikes a steel block and turns around, then mine toward the left. Lemming
one finishes up with a couple of bridges, and the other lemmings build
their way out of the hole to escape from the main deck.

Left-handed: The first lemming builds at the very edge of the holding pen.
He bumps his head before the ramp closes off the pit, so he turns around
while the other lemmings fall in. Use one of them to dig away the useless
bit of ramp. While the first lemming is walking toward the left, build just
once leftward from the right side of the pit. This makes it easier to
finish building later, when it's time to leave. The first lemming builds
over the gap in the main deck (one ramp) and out over the space at the left
end of the deck (two ramps). He drops down, turns around, bashes through
the one-way barrier, and starts to build over the long gap (three ramps).
While he's building, finish the ramp to let out the other lemmings, as
they've got a long walk ahead of them.

10. **There's a lot of them about** I'll call lemmings entering at the left
L1, L2, etc., and lemmings entering from the right R1, R2, and so on. R1
blocks the right side of the island. L1 bashes into the mid-island mound.
L2 blocks off the tunnel L1 is bashing. R2 climbs over the right island's
mound. L3 blocks off the left side of the left island.

On each island, there's a little rise near the inner end that's exactly two
ramps away (and down) from the tops of the outer brick towers. Start L1 and
R2 building at the peaks of their respective take-off bumps. Make them
build again after they walk across the tops of the outer towers. To
liberate the left-island lemmings, bomb L2. To liberate the right-island
lemmings, bash through the mound with any convenient lemming.

11. **Lemmings in the attic** The first lemming builds over the gap at far
left, then starts building toward the right from under the overhanging
triangle. After he's built two or three times, some other lemming should
cut the ramp behind him to prevent walking lemmings from falling too far
off the ramp. As the ramp reaches the wall, bash through the wall into the
closed chamber, then again to reach the exit. Repair the broken ramp.

12. **Bitter Lemming** Give every lemming a parachute. (Increase the
arrival rate to make this less boring.) Make any lemming a climber. Have
him build from the right-hand edge of the stone overhang so that he drops
down to the exit platform. Make the rest of the lemmings climbers.

Alternatively, you can bash, and build, and work your way across the
pillars at the bottom.

13. **Lemming Drops** Build up from the right edge of the landing platform
to the wall with the first lemming, and make the ramp thicker with the
second. Block the left edge of the landing zone with the first lemming to
get there. Make some lemming an athlete. As soon as he lands on the narrow
wall, build twice toward the right. He'll strike the next wall and turn
back. From the left edge of the wall where he commenced building, build
toward the left to meet the side of the landing platform. He'll span the
gap, try to climb up, and be defeated by the double-thick ramp over his
head. Let him go back up the ramp he made, over the next wall, and down
onto the platform that nearly reaches the exit. Meanwhile, dig through the
first ramp to let the other lemmings onto the leader's ramps. They should
build back and forth between the walls (building twice each way) while the
leader makes a ramp off the end of the last platform and drops down to the
exit. 

14. **MENACING !!** Bash through the various obstacles. Use one lemming to
block off the left end of the main level, and another to restrain the crowd
while the leader builds a ramp across the gap (build four times) and
another up to the exit (build five times). Bomb the right-hand blocker to
release the crowd. Bomb the left-hand blocker when you don't need him any
more.

15. **Ozone friendly Lemmings** Bomb any four lemmings in about the same
spot and they'll make a hole clear through to the exit.

16. **Luvly Jubly** Mine before the first vertical pipe. When the miner is
over his head in the horizontal pipe, switch to bashing. The basher will
continue through the horizontal section, through the rocks, and let
everybody out into the area where gridwork surrounds the exit. Use five
bombers (more or less) to break through the gridwork. Stagger them slightly
so that you don't get a vertical gap where lemmings fall and die.

17. **Diet Lemmingaid** Bomb the first lemming to break the upper deck.
Count the bricks from where you clicked on him to where he exploded; bomb
another lemming exactly that far from the bar blocking the exit. (Looks
like just over three bricks to me.)

18. **It's Lemmingentry Watson** The first lemming digs near the right-hand
side of the last pillar, but not so far right as break through the edge.
The second lemming floats down to the exit. After all the other lemmings
are in the hole with the digger, bomb the digger to release them.

19. **Postcard from Lemmingland** The problem is how to surmount two walls
with only one ramp. The easiest answer is to bash straight ahead at the
first wall, so now there's only one wall to climb -- but it's too high for
the ramp. Instead, send up an athlete. Turn him around (by digging and
building) just short of the exit. Use him to mine leftward into the hole,
making a ramp for the others. Be sure to bring him in low enough that the
others can climb up, yet not so low that he continues mining off the bottom
of the scene. After helping the others, the athlete will continue to the
left end of the scene, climb up, and drop down. If you forgot to make him a
floater, he'll die in that fall.

20. **One way digging to freedom** The first lemming bashes through the
twisty post. Use the first lemming that turns around to block off the left
end of the platform. Send an athlete over the one-way barrier. After the
barrier, turn the athlete back (by digging and building) to bash through
the barrier.

21. **Going Their Separate Ways** Make the first lemming a floater and the
next ten climbers. While lemmings two through eleven are arriving, number
one should be building across the gaps toward the left exit. Twelve through
twenty should be floaters. To slow them down a bit, make them build
anywhere along the way until the bridges to the exit are complete.

22. **Turn around young lemmings!** Bomb the first lemming as he lands.
Shift a few pixels to the right and bomb the second lemming. This gives you
a pit with a steep side on the right and a sloping side on the left. If
it's not quite right, you can still build your way out of it.

23. **From The Boundary Line** Bash through the barrier. Many lemmings will
turn around and fall off the left side, but that's OK. After breaching the
barrier, send a climber toward the exit, but turn him around (dig and
build) and mine back down to the holding pen to make a ramp for the other
lemmings.

24. **Tightrope City** As the first lemming approaches the right-hand end
of the platform, make the second lemming a blocker. The first lemming needs
to build twice to reach the exit. (Building just once comes close, but no
cigar.) Meanwhile, make the last lemming, number 80, a blocker to stop
lemmings from falling off the left-hand end of the platform. When the exit
ramp is done, use the last builder to go over the blocker's head and let
the other lemmings out. Bomb the two blockers when the other lemmings are
gone.

25. **Cascade** The first lemming and the last nine should be floaters.
Lemmings two through seventy-one fall to their deaths. The leader floats
down, climbs the stairs, builds across the gap, bashes through the pillar,
and builds over the gap to the exit. 

This level has the greatest disparity between the required performance (12%
saved) and possible performance (100% saved). See the _Challenges_.

26. **I have a cunning plan** This is the same as Fun 9, but you have to
save all of the lemmings and you've only got two bashers. Delay some of the
lemmings (numbers two through six, or so) by making them build. Make each
one build starting a bit further to the left, so that their ramps overlap
to make one very thick ramp. Be sure they don't build all the way to the
post. Meanwhile, start the first lemming bashing through the post. He might
be all the way through before another lemming arrives, but if the next
lemming does turn back, he'll be blocked and saved by the thick ramp.

27. **The Island of the Wicker people** The first lemming digs below the
right side of the entry until the hole is deep enough to trap new arrivals.
(A couple of lemmings will walk past and fall, but that's OK.) He switches
>from digging to mining and eventually comes out the right side of the
floating island. He should emerge just above a dangling root which keeps
the lemmings from falling too far. Send two climbers over the mountains and
use one lemming to block off the left side of the mainland. Block the far
right end of the mainland with the first climber and use the second climber
to dig a tunnel back through the mountains. Build up to the exit going
right-to-left. Bomb the blockers.

28. **Lost something?** The hidden exit is in the floating mound slightly
to the right of the entrance. Make the first lemming a climber so he can
get over the twig; make the second lemming a blocker when he's anywhere
left of the entrance. The first lemming starts building immediately after
climbing over the twig and arrives at the exit blob after building four
times. Bash into the mound just above its steel base to reach the exit.
Bash the restraining twig to let the other lemmings follow. Bomb the
leftover blocker.

29. **Rainbow Island** The lead lemming (the first one out of the
right-most entrance) digs partway up the next arch. His hole should be deep
enough to trap other lemmings before the next one catches up to him. At the
far right of that cavity, bash toward the right. If a lemming manages to
walk up on the next arch from the tunnel-in-progress, make him dig to
rejoin the others. 

Just before the cusp at the bottom of the second cavity, dig again with any
lemming who's walking toward the right. When he starts digging into the
arch below, switch to mining so that the lemmings won't fall to far. Bash
to the right out of that cavity and the next one.

30. **The Crankshaft** This is like Fun 14, but with no bashers and not
enough builders for ramps clear over the obstructing pillars. But there are
still plenty of miners. Make the first lemming an athlete and let him climb
over the first vertical pillar. The second lemming mines through the first
pillar while the first climbs over, floats into the valley, and starts up
the second vertical pillar. As lemmings spill into the first valley, the
advance man mines down through the third pillar, walks across the second
valley, and ascends the fourth pillar. At the fifth and last, build into
the pillar to turn him around. Half-way back across the plateau, mine down
toward the second valley. Let the advance man walk back across the second
valley and up to the previous plateau, where he'll repeat the procedure.
When the main body of lemmings reach the last vertical pillar, mine down
toward the exit. Meanwhile, the advance lemming will walk off the left end
of the setup. That's OK, he's not needed.

4.3 Taxing Solutions
--------------------

1. **If at first you don`t succeed..** This is like Fun 15, but without
enough bashers for the easy solution. Instead of bashing through each of
the columns, make one lemming dig down slightly and then bash across under
all three columns. Be sure to start the ramp across the gap low enough that
the basher won't cut it when he emerges.

2. **Watch out, there`s traps about** The first left-hand lemming (L1) digs
just before the steel lining of the pool, while the first right-hand
lemming (R1) starts digging immediately. When R1's pit is deep enough to
trap other lemmings, switch to mining. Make R2 dig if you want to save him.
As L1 reaches the bottom of the steel blocks, switch him to mining. As L1
and R1 break through the bottom of the floating island, all the lemmings
should have a safe landing path.

Bash through the small, irregular blob below the left-hand entrance. Send a
climber over the other obstacle toward the left. Build once over the trap
there, then start building again after the trap. After building three or
four times, the advance man can drop down and walk to the exit. Bash the
last obstacle with any convenient lemming.

3. **Heaven can wait (we hope!!!!)** This is the first level with real time
pressure. While the first lemming walks toward the end of the platform, the
second one digs into it. The first lemming digs at the edge. The second
lemming switches from digging to bashing when he's down to the last layer
of bricks. The first lemming switches from digging to building when he's a
little bit lower than the second lemming. Stop the basher by making him
build before he reaches the end of the platform. Now you have a little
tunnel for the incoming lemmings to mill about in.

The first lemming builds up to the exit platform. When he's nearly there,
resume bashing out of the lower platform, and crank the release rate up to
99. If the first lemming turns around because of bumping the exit platform,
you can turn him around in the tunnel by making him build. You might need
to, because you'll be running out of time.

4. **Lend a helping hand....** The first right-hand lemming (R1) digs. The
first left-hand lemming (L1) bumps the wall and turns around. At the first
joint in the bricks, he begins building. L2 mines toward the right, then
switches to bashing to make a passage under the dividing wall. Meanwhile,
stop R1's digging by making him build instead. His hole should be just deep
enough so that the right-side lemmings don't step up and walk into the
trap. When L1 has built a couple of times, cut the ramp below him using any
other lemming. L1 continues to build until he meets the wall just below the
first gnasher. He builds back and forth between the walls, avoiding the
gnashers as much as possible. (I've never figured out exactly what sets
them off.) When he's above them, mend the broken ramp and continue building
up to the exit.

5. **The Prison!** Upper exit: Block the right edge of the landing
platform. Build right-to-left until meeting the pillar at left, then
left-to-right. After building under the entrance, dig a hole through the
ramp so that the builder is alone. Continue building up to the pipes that
divide the scene. Bash through them and build again to the pipes blocking
the upper exit area. Bash, fall between the pipes, and bash again. If you
bash the wrong way, build to void falling. Bump the underside of the
previous ramp, turn around, and bash through to the exit. Build over the
hole in the earlier ramp to free the mass of lemmings. Bomb the blocker to
clean up. 

Lower exit: The first lemming builds from the extreme right edge of the
landing platform, while the second blocks the rest of the lemmings. You
have to stretch the ramp as much as possible to meet the pipes beneath the
steel block that houses the torches. When the ramp from the platform to the
pipes is complete, dig down in the first pipe, then build. The leading
lemming will turn around, so build right-to-left into the underside of the
original ramp. On returning to the pipes, bash, then build immediately to
avoid falling between the pipes. The lemming will turn around each time, so
finish joining the under-ramp with the original one. After penetrating the
pipes, build across toward the exit. Bash through to it just as for the
upper exit. Bomb the blocker to let the other lemmings through.

6. **Compression Method 1** The crushers only crush one lemming with each
stroke, so you need them bunched up to minimize your losses. The first
lemming on the extreme right should dig after turning toward the left. When
he's waist-deep, make him bash toward the left instead. About this time,
the first lemming on the extreme left will be dropping down. Make him a
blocker just under the steel edge of the entry complex. Wait for all the
other lemmings to collect to his left, then bomb him. A tight little mob of
lemmings will travel under the crushers, and about 60% will emerge safely
on the far side.

7. **Every Lemming for himself!!!** This is the same as Tricky 4, but with
tighter limits and fewer resources. The first lemming climbs over the
one-way obstruction, builds against the bollard at the end of the deck,
turns around, and bashes through the one-way barrier. (He then continues
over the mountains and dies a wet and lonely death off the other end of the
deck.) Make the second emerging lemming a blocker. The new leader builds
across the islands towards the exit, stretching the ramps carefully because
there are none extra. Bomb the blocker and you're all done.

8. **The Art Gallery** This is the same as Tricky 5, but now every lemming
must be saved. Fortunately, the same method suffices.

9. **Perseverance** This is like Fun 10, but now every lemming must be
saved. Start as for Fun 10, but instead of making the floater a blocker,
have him mine soon after landing. The steel block to his right will make
him stop and go back after excavating a turn-around for the others.

10. **Izzie Wizzie lemmings get busy** This is like Tricky 6, but with
fewer resources and no expendable lemmings. Build left-to-right in the
first holder to let all the lemmings proceed to the second one. At the left
lip of the second holder, make the last lemming build so he doesn't fall in
with the others. Build again as needed to land him on the third holder. He
can either build over the middle of that holder or build out of it, but in
either case he needs to mine down through the two bricks that make up its
right-hand side. This brings him low enough that he won't die as he falls
to the last holder. Build up from there to the exit. Build left-to-right in
the second holder to let the other lemmings follow.

11. **The ascending pillar scenario** This is like Tricky 7, but you must
save all the lemmings. The first lemming near the right side of the column
and the second one digs immediately. There should be a narrow division
between the holes. Turn the second digger to the left by building when he's
about waist-deep. Stop the first digger when his hole is deep enough to
capture the remaining lemmings.  After the second digger climbs out of his
hole, he'll build from pillar to pillar and descend to the exit just as in
Tricky 7.  When it's safe, there should still be incoming lemmings dropping
into the left-hand hole and walking into the right-hand one. Use the last
one of these to dig down between the holes and release the other lemmings.
Turn him around by building before he gets too deep.

12. **Livin` On The Edge** The first lemming builds toward the brick
divider while the second and third lemmings block the others in. The leader
needs to build twice to reach the divider, which he bashes through. From
there, he simply builds from each column to the next. The columns are
exactly one ramp-length apart, but there are a couple of spare ramps in
case you start building a little too soon. When the building is all done,
bomb the right-hand blocker to release the seven trapped lemmings. Bomb the
remaining blocker to finish up.

13. **Upsidedown World** The first lemming blocks off the right-hand end of
the world. The second turns toward the left. Up among the inverted roots,
he mines briefly (one or two strokes), then bashes toward the left. After
climbing the ramp to the second section of world, he mines again, starting
just short of the first protruding root. Deep inside the world, he switches
to bashing. If he's deep enough, he should pass slightly below the trap. If
he's shallow enough, he should stop bashing by himself in the cleft just
before the last one-way barrier. Send a climber over the barrier. Near the
exit, turn him around (dig and build), then mine and bash back to the other
lemmings. When everyone else is safe, bomb the blocker.

14. **Hunt the Nessy....** The first lemming builds off the right-hand end
of the first island, while the second and third lemmings block the rest.
The leader builds from island to island until he reaches the last island
before Nessy's head. There's a choice here: the overhead route or going
through the neck. To go over the head, start building at mid-island. While
walking on the head, dig and bash so as to drop onto the peak of the next
island. If you're off-target, the lemming will fall too far and die. To go
through the neck, start at the extreme end of the island and stretch the
ramp to meet the neck as low as possible. Bash momentarily to avoid
breaking the top of the ramp, then mine down across the neck. Build up
under Nessy's chin and drop down onto the island.

Build across the islands toward the exit, bash or build over the wellhouse,
and the leader is safe. Bomb the right-hand blocker to let loose the other
lemmings, then bomb the other blocker when they're on their way.

15. **What an AWESOME level** The first lemming bashes through the
creature's head slightly above eyebrow level, while the second lemming
blocks off the crowd. On exiting the head, the leader builds across to the
next landing point. After dropping down, his way is blocked by a spot that
needs only a single step laid down. At the peak of the next section, he
needs to build two or three times to drop onto the following coil. Mining
along the following slope makes smooth surface from which to start building
up toward the exit. A little experimentation will show you where to build
so as to avoid those pesky stars. When the exit ramp is complete, bomb the
blocker and let the other lemmings through.

16. **Mary Poppins` land** The first two lemmings float down while the
third one stands on the steel plate and blocks the rest. One of the
floaters builds into the first slope quite high up in order to turn around.
After descending a bit, he builds up toward the entrance. Better to come in
low than high, since the aim is to catch the lemmings as they drop off the
platform. The other floater continues over the top and drops down. After
crossing the smooth section, he turns around by building against any
convenient bump and then builds back toward the second drop. When both of
the ramps are in place, bomb the blocker.

17. **X marks the spot** This is like Fun 23, but you have to save more
lemmings with fewer resources. The most important shortage is the lack of
blockers. To restrain the suicidal lemmings, make the first lemming mine
shortly after he first lands. He'll be stopped by the steel section,
leaving a safe turn-around. From that point on, apply any of the solutions
>from Fun 23.

18. **Tribute to M.C.Escher** This is like Fun 11, but without any
climbers. Build toward the one-way barrier from one ramp-length away. From
the top of that ramp, build right-to-left over to the left wall, then
left-to-right toward the barrier. Before extending over the top of the
barrier, though, cut the ramp down below with a bomber. Make the builder a
floater. He drops down on the far side, then builds over the exit to avoid
it. After turning against the far wall, he bashes back through the barrier.
(You might need another bomber to cut the lowest part of the ramp.) Bomb
any of the advancing lemmings to break the ramp over the exit.

19. **Bomboozal** This is like Fun 18, but there are no blockers. So, you
need to measure out the distance a bomber will walk before exploding and
plan accordingly. 

20. **Walk the web rope** Breaching the first strand of the first web is
the touchiest point. One way is to make the first lemming bash just as he's
turning against the web. He'll cut the strand on his backstroke, then
continue off to the left. If he cuts the strand going toward the right,
he'll also make a hole in the strand below and lemmings will fall through.
The same technique works on the second strand, but after that forward
bashing works fine without making dangerous holes in the web. (Notice that
you don't have to cut some strands.) As the lemmings approach the second
web, make a blocking ramp by having three or more lemmings build quite
close to each other. This will prevent any lemmings that turn back from
going all the way to the left-hand web. Build twice to reach up on the side
of the second web before bashing into it. Bash or mine across the web and
go down to the exit.

21. **Feel the heat!** Make the first lemming climb, then build toward the
exit from the edge of the steel plate encasing the torch. Build three
times, then switch to bashing when he's just over the exit. Make another
climber. Turn him around by digging and building at the brick/steel joint.
As he turns around, make him mine toward the waiting lemmings. When he's
down to their level, bash to avoid mining into the floor.

22. **Come on over to my place** This is like Fun 27, but resources are
tighter and every lemming must be saved. Like Fun 27, however, you can take
either the high road or the low road.

For the low road, make the first lemming a floater and let him float off
the end of the platform. Make the second one a blocker at the extreme end.
Turn the first lemming around by digging and building just short of the
exit. As soon as he's walking again, start building right-to-left. Back up
on the entrance platform, make the third lemming build across the little
gap toward the steps. While he's still building, the fourth lemming should
mine into the steps further up to make a turn-around. Stop the miner by
making him build. All this while, the leader should continue building up
under the platform. When he meets the steel block under the platform, the
exit way is ready. Dig just before the blocker, then bash to dislodge him.
Everybody will pour safely down the ramp and out the exit.

For the low road, make the first lemming a floater and use him to block the
right-hand end of the entrance platform. The second lemming bridges the gap
at the left-hand end of the platform, and the third makes a turn-around as
described above. Any convenient lemming builds up to the steps of the
overhead platform. As the first lemming drops from the steps at the far
end, he should dig, then build, to stop lemmings from walking off the
right-hand end. Build across the gap to the exit using every lemming that
comes along until it's safe. Now, back to the entrance area. Make the last
lemming to emerge a floater. Just short of the blocker, use him to dig and
bash. He'll free the blocker and they'll both float down to the exit while
the other lemmings finish taking the long way around.

23. **King of the castle** Like Tricky 8, but you have to save more
lemmings with fewer builders. The general plan is the same, but remember
that you can extend a ramp faster by making additional builders start at
the extreme end. You should have lemmings landing safely across the gap
after using only four builders. The fastest way to close the gap the other
way is to build under the first ramp instead of trying to match up with the
top of it.

24. **Take a running jump.....** The first lemming bridges the gap. Others
can assist, or delay by building sooner. Everybody drops down and turns
around at the far end. Any lemming builds from the pit before the exit up
toward the exit. I cannot imagine why this level is rated "Taxing."

25. **Follow the leader...** This is like Fun 19, but there aren't any
diggers. So while the first lemming goes on to build the exit ramp, use the
second to bash into the keyhole, and the third to make a turn-around in the
preceding mound.

26. **Triple Trouble** Lemmings from the top, left, and right entrances
will use the prefixes "T", "L", and "R" respectively. T1 digs just past the
rightmost bump on top of the floating exit stone. T2 digs just before the
same bump. T3 digs immediately upon landing, then builds so as to turn
around. T3 digs again near the left-hand side of the stone. Notice that T2
should stop digging by himself upon reaching a little cavity along the
interior wall where he's digging.

Make one of the left-entrance lemmings (we'll call him L1) a climber. He
should build from about the second rivet of the steel block. Meanwhile, T1
should commence mining outward when he's level with the exit. T3 should do
the same. T1 will fall to his death, but T3 will be saved by L1's ramp. L1
has bumped his head and turned back. When he arrives again, he should be
able to close the gap from his ramp to the one cut by T3. On his next pass,
he can bash through to the exit. Any left-entrance lemming can build once
to release all the left-entrance lemmings.

While all this is happening, make a right-entrance climber, R1. He'll do
the same things that L1 did, except that his corresponding ramp is already
cut. When he's finished, build the right-entrance lemmings out of their
hole. Good luck getting one that's walking the right way.

27. **Call in the bomb squad** Block the ends of the entrance platform.
Build, block, and bomb your way through the underside of the exit platform.
You might find it easiest to build right-to-left at first, then turn
against the excavated wall to end up going left-to-right.

28. **POOR WEE CREATURES!** This is another level where you can follow
either the high road or the low one. I first found my way over the high
road, as follows. Make the first lemming a floater just before he lands.
Make him a climber before he meets the pole to his right. He climbs the
pole and walks out on the arm which extends toward the right. Building once
against the bulb at the end of the arm turns him around and he builds once
to reach the thin platform over the entrance. Building against the wall
after dropping down turns him again. He drops down one more level and then
builds from half-way across that cube. Building twice plus a few more steps
makes a ramp where incoming lemmings can land in safety. The leader
immediately bashes into the side of the pillar and out through the arm.

After dropping down into the rocks and crystals, the leader has to bash
once more to clear a path towards the exit. You can delay the next few
lemmings by making the leader bash at the base of the blocking crystal
while the next lemming bashes lower down. Build over the electric arc and
raise the release rate to 99.

This solution for following the low road is entirely due to Frank O'Neill.
Make the first lemming a floater. Let him turn around against the pillar
and make him a builder from the leftmost bump on the base. (Click on him an
instant before he gets to the top of the bump.) One build plus four or five
steps of the second should close the space under the left-hand overhang,
and he should climb and turn around landing on the steps he just built. As
he lands, make him build back toward the pillar. Nine steps into the third
build he hits the pillar and turns around. Instantly make him build again.
This should start saving the falling lemmings at the end of your build.

Closing the space to the overhang is important, as this traps all the
following lemmings in a closed loop. When the builder comes back to the
pillar, make him a basher and as he finishes his tunnel and starts
floating. Make the next lemming through the tunnel a blocker right on the
lip of the tunnel. When the floater hits the lower ledge, make him build
and use the last two builds to get him across the water. Make him a basher
to tunnel over to the other side of the crystals and on towards the exit.
This requires one or two basher clicks depending on how high he is when he
starts digging.

He can now go all the way to the exit except for the electric arc just
before the end. You should still have left 1 miner and perhaps 1 basher.
Just in front of the arc mine, then bash, then block and nuke the poor wee
creature. This allows the others to pass under the arc when they get
there. (If you had one more builder, this would not be necessary, but
that's lemming life). Finally, blow away the blocker who's stopping the
others and let 'em come.

29. **How do I dig up the way?** Like Tricky 3, but with fewer builders and
more lemmings to be saved. Make the first one an athlete and the second a
blocker. The athlete will float down to the right and the others will fall
down to the left. The athlete builds across the gap and then climbs the far
wall of the canyon. Turn him around by digging and building just before he
reaches the exit so that he can mine down to the base of the canyon wall.
Free the other lemmings by bashing through the base of the plateau on which
they first landed.

30. **We all fall down** Just like Fun 13 and Tricky 2, but with still more
lemmings.

4.4 Mayhem Solutions
--------------------

1. **Steel Works** The first five lemmings all become floaters. The first
walks right into the pit. The second blocks soon after landing, the third
builds after turning against the second, and the fourth blocks off the
left-hand end of the platform.  The fifth just wanders around helplessly.
There should be enough space between the two blockers that the ramp doesn't
extend over the left-hand blocker's head. The idea is to catch the incoming
lemmings and hold them in that area.

Meanwhile, the first lemming builds right-to-left in the deep valley to
make a safe landing for the crowd to follow later. On meeting the left
wall, he continues building toward the right. If he built twice to reach
the left wall, he should make it over the top of the right wall on the
first pass. Descending on the far side of that heap, he should start
building when he's level with the floating block, before he drops into that
annoying notch between the blocks. After building three times, he drops
onto that block and builds again to reach the far side of the ocean. Once
safely over the land again, he can dig through the current ramp to avoid
hitting the wall.

In the far right section, build back and forth up the chimney to reach the
exit. Notice that the lower portion of the chimney is narrower than the
upper, so you have to overlap your ramps differently to make efficient use
of them. When the leader is safely headed for the exit, bomb the right-hand
blocker to let loose the crowd. Bomb the left blocker to finish up.

2. **The Boiler Room** The first lemming builds from the left end of the
landing platform while the second blocks the crowd. After building four
times, the leader is just short of the hanging wall. He drops down to the
middle platform and builds from its left end toward the pillar holding the
exit platform. On meeting the pillar, he builds again toward the right and
bumps his head. When he comes toward the right again, he builds again to
close the gap, then builds toward the left. Each time he builds, he bumps
his head and turns around. Continue building up under the exit platform,
one brick at a time, until only a small gap remains. Block and bomb the
leader to make a hole in the platform near the exit. Bomb the earlier
blocker to free the crowd, and use any convenient lemming to fix the ramp
leading to the exit.

3. **It`s hero time!** This is like Fun 24, but you have to save all the
lemmings and you have fewer resources to work with. The first lemming needs
to be an athlete, and the last should dig as soon as he's over the left end
of the middle platform. After landing on the middle platform, the erstwhile
digger bashes through the one-way barrier before the main body of lemmings
reaches it going the other way. To avoid a fatal dip in the pool, the odd
lemming should build while walking in the crevice that leads to it.
Meanwhile, the athletic leader has climbed and floated off the right-hand
end of the platform. Upon landing, he should mine through to the exit
before walking into the crusher. He'll be done mining in time for the other
lemmings to follow safely.

4. **The Crossroads** This is the same scene as Fun 25, but you must save
every lemming using only bashers. The strategy is the same, however. Bash
through the gridwork so that you enter the side of the spiderweb about
halfway up. Bash at the lower right-hand corner of the web section you land
in to make an exit for lemmings moving the right direction. 

5. **Down, along, up. In that order** The scene is the same as Fun 28, but
now builders are a precious resource. Dig through the upper three steps of
the ladder, staggering the holes so that lemmings won't fall too far. Bash
out the left side of the ladder from the last step so that all the lemmings
are marching left along the ground. A few bricks from the left end of the
platform, make the seventh lemming a blocker. At the last brick-to-brick
joint, start building toward the bottom step of the exit ladder. Put
another blocker under the step to keep the others from drowning, and a
third one at the far right, under the entry staircase. Now there are two
groups of lemmings circulating between blockers: the vanguard, who will
build steps up to the exit; and the army which mills about while waiting. 

When the ramp to the first step is done, make the first lemming onto the
step a blocker at the extreme left end. The next lemming should build
toward the blocker. If you get the spacing right, the builder will build to
the blocker, turn around, and build to the edge of the next step. Repeat
this process three times to make a path to the exit. Bomb the blocker who
holds back the crowd. After the crowd clears, bomb the other blockers.

6. **One way or another** This is like Tricky 9, but you must save every
lemming. Since there wasn't any reason to kill them before, use the same
stategies. The only catch is that there aren't any climbers, so separate
the advance man for the right-handed solution by digging through the ramp
behind him. Repair the ramp later to save the other lemmings.

7. **Poles Apart** This is like Fun 20, but there's a shortage of bashers
and builders. The first lemming builds across the gap from the right-hand
edge of the landing platform. The next two or three lemmings go for a swim.
The first lemming across the gap digs into the second step to keep others
>from climbing back up later. When he's deep enough, he builds to stop
digging. Bash through the first two poles. Make somebody a climber. Atop
the next pole, the climber digs down, then builds at ground level. He stops
building just as he's touching the next pole, so he climbs again. Let him
drop down and climb up the following pole, which he digs away. Skip the one
after that, and dig away the last pole on the right. Build twice this time,
to be sure of reaching the exit platform. Bash through the two remaining
poles and you're done.

8. **Last one out is a rotten egg!** The first lemming builds from the
right edge of the landing platform while the second and third block in the
rest. When the ramp is finished, make the leader a climber and let him
ascend to the top of the one-way barrier. Toward the right side of the
barrier, dig. Consider a line drawn along the ramp extending into the
barrier. When the digger reaches that line, build. He'll lay a step or two
and turn around. Mine toward the ramp. If the miner emerges slightly above
the ramp, just let him walk down and turn back when he meets the blocker.
If he comes in a bit low, make him build to repair any damage to the top of
the ramp. In either case, dig again as he approaches the right-hand end of
the slope he just cut through the barrier. Bomb the right-hand blocker to
let the other lemmings join him in the hole. Bomb the left-hand blocker
when he's not needed any more. When the digger reaches the bottom of the
barrier, all the surviving lemmings will drop out and walk to the exit.

9. **Curse of the Pharaohs** This is like Fun 29, but once again you have
to save more with less. The first lemming blocks at the right-hand end of
the pillar where they first land. Bash three times to reach the area with
the twin stairs, the left set of which is broken. Bash through the bottom
of the broken stairs so that the lemmings aren't all crowded in a tiny
space. Finish as in Fun 29.

10. **Pillars of Hercules** There are at least four substantially different
solutions here, as you can follow a lower or higher path to either the
left- or right-hand exit. The descriptions here work for heading either
left or right.

Low road: Make the first few lemmings floaters. Start building back and
forth between the pillars immediately. Lemmings will continue to die as
they fall until your ramps reach slightly above the midpoint of the
pillars, where they have short protrusions on the outer side. Once the
falling lemmings are safe, send a climber over the top to the left or right
and turn up the release rate. Dig through the platform at the top of the
pillar to avoid a dangerous fall. When the climber is on solid ground
again, build. If you're heading left, build up to the taller
brick-on-a-stick. He'll bump into it, turn around, climb on the outside of
the pillar, fall back, and return. Build across to the shorter
brick-on-a-stick, and from there to the exit. If you're heading right,
build over the perforated bridge to the brick, and from there up to the
exit. Bash through the side of the pillar to release the rest of the
lemmings onto the ramps.

High road: The first two lemmings float down. The first climbs the right
pillar and the second climbs the left pillar. As they reach the ends of
their respective overhangs, they each build. They both bump their heads and
turn around. At the edge of the space between the pillars, they build
toward each other to seal it off. Other lemmings close up the little spaces
at the outside ends of the outer ramps. Extend one of the middle ramps up
to the sloping stone wall. (You might find it useful to take a scoop out of
the wall with a basher.) Send a basher into the stone and cut the ramp
behind him by digging so that he's alone. Turn up the release rate. Near
the end of the stone, dig down until only a very thin support remains. From
there, build toward the exit. The builder will bump his head repeatedly,
but by building as far out as possible, you'll eventually clear the
stonework and make it over the exit platform. Repair the cut ramp to bring
on the remaining lemmings.

11. **We all fall down** Just like Fun 13, Tricky 2, and Taxing 30, but
with even more lemmings.

12. **The Far Side** After bumping the wall and turning left, the first
lemming should be a climber. The second lemming should build (just once)
right-to-left starting two ramps away from the left side of the entrance
pit. This incomplete ramp will make life much easier later on. The climber
digs down in the dirt plug between the steel sections, then changes to
bashing when he's low enough to get under the steel. He drops down to the
next formation and again digs between the steel blocks. He can turn around
by bashing against the left-hand steel block or by building momentarily. In
either case, he should eventually bash toward the right so as to drop onto
the little dirtball at the bottom of the scene. From there, he builds
across to the mainland and tunnels between the steel blocks. Emerging on
the far side, he builds back and forth to make a series of ramps to the
exit. While he's doing that, finish the ramp started by the second lemming.
This sends the rest of the lemmings on their way and avoids running out of
time. 

13. **The Great Lemming Caper** This scene is the same as Fun 26, but now
there are only two builders. There are a surprising number of solutions
here, of which I'll give two. 

My solution: The first lemming digs down along the right-hand edge of the
stone pile where he landed. The second lemming digs immediately upon
landing. The second lemming blocks himself in his hole about one and a half
stones down, while the first lemming goes down two stones before commencing
to build. He bumps into the capstone of the next pile and turns back. From
the base of his ramp, he bashes toward the left right under the second
lemming's feet. The second lemming drops down and walks toward the right
while the first one bashes through the stone and drops into the holding
area at the left. The second lemming bashes across the top of the next
stone pile, builds across to the last one, and bashes through that. When
he's far enough along, make the first lemming a climber so that he can
ascend from the holding pen and follow his companion.

Solution from Lionel Maiaux (L.Maiaux@frec.bull.fr): The first lemming
builds from the right-hand edge of the first stone over toward the second
pile. The second lemming digs immediately and eventually comes out the
bottom. In preparation for that, make him a climber. The first lemming
drops onto the top of the second pile. When he's over the left edge of the
underlying stones, he digs. When he's just below the capstone (i.e., when
there's air on his left), he bashes toward the right. He emerges on the
right on a stone balcony. From the right edge of that, he builds over to
the last stone pile and bashes through it to the exit. The second lemming,
meanwhile, has descended all the way through the initial pile and climbed
up the side of the second to join the path of the first lemming. This takes
long enough that the way is complete by the time he gets there.

14. **Pea Soup** This level is unplayable in black and white because the
little islands in the soup are invisible.

15. **The Fast Food Kitchen...** Just like Tricky 10. Time is shorter,
though, so turn up the release rate at some convenient point.

16. **Just a Minute...** Dig through the thin stone overlying the small
cavity. Bash toward the exit. Turn the release rate up to 99. You'll just
barely make it in time.

17. **Stepping Stones** This level features an obvious solution which
requires careful execution, and a much easier solution that's a bit more
obscure. The obvious solution is to build across the stepping stones (three
triple ramps for each span) while a blocker holds back the crowd, then dig
out the blocker and use the last builder to stop digging.

The less obvious solution is to plant a blocker toward the right, then
build three times left-to-right to reach the vertical wall. Dig through the
ramp so that the builder is the only lemming on it. Bash through the wall,
and build back and forth (twice each way) in the narrow cavity to reach the
level of the overhead stonework. Bash toward the right. Repair the ramp.
When the basher is over the exit, mine or dig.

18. **And then there were four....** The only real difficulty here is
paying attention to four streams of lemmings at once. I'll refer to the
four populations as TR (top right), TL (top left), BR (bottom right), and
BL (bottom left). Make BL1 and BR1 climbers, then make them build as soon
as they've ascended the low retaining walls. While they're building, make
TR1 dig at the first thin section of ground and make TL1 build twice to
avoid falling. BL1 will eventually bump the wall and turn around. Make him
build back and forth to make a path to the exit. BR1 should build just long
enough to drop onto the far side of the water, then build back the other
way to close the gap. Like BL1, he now builds back and forth to reach the
exit. 

Meanwhile, TL lemmings are approaching the left side of the water. Build up
under the ramp left by BL1 to save most of them and eventually join the
ramps. TR lemmings fall onto the ramps built by BR1, so they're safe. Put
up ramps in the BL and BR landing areas to surmount the retaining walls.
Raise the release rate and watch everybody go home.

19. **Time to get up!** This is like Tricky 11, but there aren't any
bashers. To keep lemmings from falling too far off the ramp, build a second
ramp underneath it, starting about half as far from the wall. Bomb two
lemmings to break through the first wall, and one or two to break the
second wall and reach the exit.

20. **No added colours or Lemmings** The second lemming blocks the crowd
while the first one bashes, then builds. If he builds at the last possible
moment, he'll bump the exit platform and turn around. He mines under the
blockers feet to release the other lemmings. There's nothing to stop him,
so he mines clear through the floor into the lower part of the scene. The
last lemming walking up the ramp takes pity on him and mines through the
last step of the ramp. He falls. Make both of the fallen lemmings climbers
and they'll climb out to the exit.

21. **With a twist of lemming please** Same scene as Fun 4. Parachutes for
everybody. (Turn up the release rate to 90 or so and click like crazy.)
Make any lemming a climber. When he's over the left edge of the slot in the
stonework, make him dig down. He should far enough right that there's air
on his right. Dig down to the very last joint in the stones, then build
over to the first little platform. Walk across and build again. He'll bump
his head and turn back, retracing his steps all the way to where the other
lemmings are waiting. When he's back again, build once more to reach the
exit. Bash out of the holding pen to free the remaining lemmings. Good luck
picking one that's walking the right way!

22. **A BeastII of a level** The second and third lemmings block in the
crowd while the first one builds twice to reach the first chandelier. He
bashes through the chain and again through the right-hand candle, then
builds once to reach the next chandelier. Repeat the bashing and building
to reach the large lumpy object. Bash, then mine to come out near the
bottom right of it. Build three times, then drop onto the end of the bridge
section. You could bash through each remaining obstacle, but it's easier to
dig in about waist-deep, then bash across to the exit. Build to stop
bashing, and build again at any convenient point to turn back toward the
exit. Bomb the right-hand blocker, then the left-hand one when he's not
needed. 

23. **Going up.......** Build immediately as the first lemming lands. Keep
building until lemmings are walking up the long diagonal tube. The first
lemming walking down the tube should build toward the left fairly high up.
Since he'll soon bump his head, build again with another lemming to squeeze
through the wall. The first returning lemming at the bottom of the tube
should bash to make a hole in the roof of the entry shelter. Now, lemmings
returning down the tube, inside or outside, will come back to the entrance
area. Some lemming walking down the outside of the should now commence
building toward the big barrier. He needs to reach it as high as possible
but without going to much outside the scene. After he's on his way, another
lemming should bash the bottom of the ramp so that there aren't any
needless fatalities. The fearless leader builds right up to the barrier and
bashes into it. Make him a floater as he bashes along. He drops out the far
end onto a diagonal bar which ends in a ball. Build against the ball to
turn around, then build again to make a landing strip for the other
lemmings. The leader bumps his head, turns around, and returns to the ball.
Bash through it and he's home free. Repair the cut ramp and the other
lemmings will follow.

24. **All or Nothing** You can only win by chance. What a useless level! 

25. **Have a nice day!** This is the same scene as Tricky 13, and the same
plan works. Turn up the release rate to finish in time, of course.

26. **The Steel Mines of Kessel** Make the ninth Lemming a blocker in any
convenient place. Now you've got eight Lemmings circulating between the
thick barrier on the right and a long twig on the left. Using only one
builder, build up from the last twig toward the thick barrier. (This isn't
absolutely required, but makes the next part easier.) Pin a blocker on the
wall as high and far right as you can, and bomb him. Repeat five times. You
might possibly get Lemmings trapped to the right of your blocker sometimes.
In that case, bomb a trapped Lemming, not the blocker -- you'll make more
progress that way.

After penetrating the barrier, you've got two Lemmings in your advance
group. (All the rest are still waiting behind #9 -- remember him?)  Build
across the gap. Block and bomb one Lemming to get through the thin barrier.
Use the last advance Lemming to build over the remaining obstacles and the
trap.

Bomb the blocker holding back the crowd, and you're home free with exactly
72 surviving Lemmings.

27. **Just a Minute (Part Two)** This is almost the same as Mayhem 16, but
that handy cavity is missing. The first lemming bashes into the stone wall.
The second lemming digs as soon as he's safely inside the tunnel, then
bashes after he's deep enough to capture additional lemmings. Turn the
release rate up to 99. You'll be done with a second or two to spare.

28. **Mind the step.....** Let the lemming walk up to the top and turn
around. Start digging over the left-most floating brick. When he falls onto
the brick, build about seven steps and then bash in order to drop so as to
drop onto the next brick-on-a-stick. Build twice from there to reach the
last brick-on-a-stick, then twice more to reach the first stone pillar.
Bash into the pillar. Dig at the far side, then build over to the next one.
This digging makes a handy backstop, as the lemming turns around during the
next step. Bash through the next pillar, then build up toward the small
hole in the stonework. The lemming will bump and turn back. When he returns
and steps into the hole, bash through to the stone steps. 

Starting at the fourth step from the bottom, build up toward the left. A
couple of passes might be needed in order to make a firm connection to the
wall, as it's hard to avoid bumping the lemming's head. When it's safe,
bash into the wall. The lemming should be high enough that there will be a
break overhead where he passes the right-hand end of the brick arch. After
he strikes the steel in the middle and turns back, build so as to climb out
this overhead gap. Build across the crusher at the top of the arch. Bash
through to the exit at the left end of the arch.

29. **Save Me** "Blockers on steps" is the theme of this level. The first
lemming builds starting at the left-hand edge of the right-most brick,
while the second and third lemmings block off the others. The builder
builds four times, then blocks at the very top of his ramp. Build a
left-to-right escape ramp that goes over the right-hand blocker's head.
Build a right-to-left ramp from the top of the long ramp to the edge of the
long overhead platform. They should meet without a gap. While the overhead
ramp is in progress, you should extend the escape ramp once more so that it
will catch lemmings falling from the growing overhead ramp. Near the left
end of the overhead platform, plant a blocker with two lemmings to his left
and the rest to his right. The two lemmings should build up to the pillar,
and one should bash into it. Once he's safe inside the pillar, the basher
digs down until he's so low that bashing again lets him fall out the little
irregularity toward the left side of the bottom. This maneuver is
important, as it makes it most likely that the other lemming is walking the
right way when he falls out. 

If the two advance lemmings are very close together, delay one by making
him build against some handy obstacle. After they're well on their way,
release the other lemmings by building over the head of the blocker on the
overhead platform. As the first lemming drops onto the platform above the
exit, build and then block. Do the same as the second lemming drops onto
the exit platform. After the body of lemmings goes to their reward, nuke
the blockers.

30. **Rendezvous at the Mountain** This scene actually comprises two
independent puzzles. The two groups of lemmings meet at the exit, but
needn't ever interact. The first lemming (L1) comes from the left-hand
entrance, but the first action is on the right. The first right-hand
lemming (R1) blocks shortly after landing.  L1 should start building from
the edge of the last rock before the trap, and L2 should block the other
lefties. When L1 has built far enough to avoid the trap, switch from
building to bashing so that he can walk on.

L1, the leading lefty, walks across the log and onto the mound. At the
highest point he can walk to, make him bash through the mound. As he exits,
he should build repeatedly to reach the corduroy bridge with the little
signpost on it. Just before the signpost, mine. L1 will break through,
bounce down the steep slope, and climb up to the exit. Release the
remaining lefties by bombing L2.

Any right-hand lemming should start building right-to-left, starting
slightly left of the landing spot. Once he's built up some distance, cut
the ramp with any other lemming so that the builder is alone. The builder's
goal is to land on top of the cobblestone arch without bumping it and
turning back. As he's about to walk off the left side of the arch, he
should dig. If he's close enough to the edge, he'll drop off by himself at
a chink between the stones part-way down. If not, switch from digging to
bashing and he'll drop off anyway. He needs to bash through the signpost,
mine and bash under the trap, and build up to the exit after surmounting
the little mound just before the water. As he nears the exit, repair the
broken ramp to let the other lemmings follow. Bomb R1 when they're gone.

5. Challenges
=============

In many levels, it's possible to save more than is strictly required. The
most dramatic example is Cascade (Tricky 25), where you need to save only
10 lemmings, but it's possible to save them all. In levels where saving
100% is already required, clever tactics lead to a savings on resources. In
every instance of We all fall down (Fun 13, Tricky 2, Taxing 30, Mayhem
11), for example, you have just as many diggers as there are lemmings. But
what if you only had half as many diggers, or one-third?

This chapter challenges you to discover the extreme limits of Lemmings. To
meet these challenges, you'll have to save more lemmings than you thought
possible, and do it on a budget.

5.1 Save the Lemmings
---------------------

In the interest of brevity, this section lists only the levels where it's
impossible to save 100% of the lemmings, with a terse explanation for each.
That's only 20 levels out of 120, so you've got your work cut out for you.
If you can improve on any of the performances listed, please let me know.

Fun 3 **Tailor-made for blockers** Save 47 of 50. Need three blockers to
direct traffic.

Fun 6 **A task for blockers and bombers** Save 48 of 50. Need two bombers
to break barriers.

Fun 18 **Let's block and blow** Save 65 of 70. Need five bombers to break
five levels.

Tricky 15 **Ozone friendly Lemmings** Save 6 of 10. (7 of 10 in PC version,
I'm told.) Need four bombers to dig.

Tricky 16 **Luvly Jubly** Save 45 of 50.  Need five bombers to dig.

Tricky 17 **Diet Lemmingaid** Save 48 of 50. Need two bombers to dig.

Tricky 18 **It's Lemmingentry Watson** Save 9 of 10. Need one bomber to
dig. But what are the two builders for?

Tricky 23 **From The Boundary Line** Save 53 of 80. No way to save the ones
that turn around.

Taxing 6 **Compression Method 1**  Save 45 of 50. Four will be crushed, and
blocker is bombed.

Taxing 7 **Every Lemming for himself!!!** Save 79 of 80. Need to use one
blocker/bomber for crowd control.

Taxing 16 **Mary Poppins` land** Save 79 of 80. Need one blocker/bomber to
hold back the crowd.

Taxing 19 **Bomboozal** Save 65 of 70. Need five bombers to drop five
levels.

Taxing 27 **Call in the bomb squad** Save 75 of 80. Need two blockers, 3
blocker/bombers.

Taxing 28 **POOR WEE CREATURES!** Save 63 of 80. It takes time to build a
landing place. This is the fastest I can do it.

Mayhem 2 **The Boiler Room** Save 79 of 80. One bomber clears the exit
path.

Mayhem 5 **Down, along, up. In that order** Save 76 of 80.  Four blockers
turn the builders as needed.

Mayhem 10 **Pillars of Hercules** Save 70 of 75.  It takes time to build a
landing place. This is the fastest I can do it.

Mayhem 19 **Time to get up!** Save 47 of 50. Two bombers blast the first
barrier, one does the second.

Mayhem 26 **The Steel Mines of Kessel** Save 72 of 80.  Six blocker/bombers
blast the thick barrier, one restrains the crowd, one cuts the thin
barrier.

Mayhem 29 **Save Me** Save 75 of 80. Two blockers guard the entry landing,
one turns the ramp, two guide arrivals at the exit.


5.2 Other Challenges
--------------------

Tricky 21 (Going their separate ways) with no floaters?
Taxing 5 (The prison) via lower exit?
Taxing 17 (X marks the spot) via any of **three** exits?
We all fall down with half as many diggers? One third?

30. **Rendezvous at the Mountain** The first lemming (L1) comes from the
left-hand entrance, but the first action is on the right. The first
right-hand lemming (R1) should dig immediately upon landing. As R1 starts
digging, L1 should start building from the edge of the last rock before the
trap. He'll eventually be blocked by a dangling root, but only after L2 has
walked safely past him. When R1 is deep enough to keep other lemmings from
walking off to the right, he builds. R2 lands at this point and bashes left
after bouncing off the wall of R1's pit. From this point, the left- and
right-hand sides can be worked separately.

L2, the leading lefty, walks across the log and onto the mound. At the
highest point he can walk to, make him bash through the mound. As he exits,
he should build repeatedly to reach the corduroy bridge with the little
signpost on it. Just before the signpost, mine. L2 will break through,
bounce down the steep slope, and climb up to the exit. Release the
remaining lefties by bashing the retaining root.

Any right-hand lemming should start building right-to-left, starting
slightly left of the landing spot. Once he's built up some distance, cut
the ramp with any other lemming so that the builder is alone. The builder's
goal is to land on top of the cobblestone arch without bumping it and
turning back. As he's about to walk off the left side of the arch, he
should dig. If he's close enough to the edge, he'll drop off by himself at
a chink between the stones part-way down. If not, switch from digging to
bashing and he'll drop off anyway. He needs to bash through the signpost,
mine and bash under the trap, and build up to the exit after surmounting
the little mound just before the water. As he nears the exit, repair the
broken ramp to let the other lemmings follow.


8. Challenges Requiring Patches
===============================

Call in the bomb squad, with more builders, one bomber.
The Boiler Room, with two diggers, 100%.

9. Patching Lemmings
====================

9.1 Macintosh
-------------

These patches apply to  Lemmings 1.4.2 for the Macintosh.

To make the manual lookup dialog accept any answer, in CODE 2, at offset
0x1F58, change B06D DB60 670C to 3B40 DB60 4E75.

I got tired of the passwords for individual levels in Lemmings, so here's a
patch I wrote to get rid of them. In CODE 3, at offset 0xD68, replace
exactly 88 bytes (11 lines in ResEdit's general editor) with the following
88 bytes (11 lines) of garble:

48E7 1F18 47ED CFB6
4245 101B 0C00 0030
6D14 0C00 0039 6E0E
4880 0440 0030 CAFC
000A DA40 60E4 0C45
0078 6E1A 4A45 6F16
5345 3B45 DBC8 2005
48C0 81FC 001E 3B40
DBF8 7001 600A 426D
DBC8 426D DBF8 7000
4CDF 18F8 4E75 4E75

You should update the corresponding dialog to make the prompt more
appropriate. I changed item 4 of DITL 2001 to read "Enter level number (1 =
Fun 1, 31 = Tricky 1, 61 = Taxing 1, 91 = Mayhem 1):" so that I won't
forget this is a patched copy.
