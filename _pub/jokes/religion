Zen			What is the sound of shit happening?
Hinduism		This shit happened before
Islam			If shit happens, it's the will of Allah
Protestantism		Let shit happen to someone else
Catholicism		If shit happens, you deserved it
Judaism			Why does shit always happen to us?
Rastafarism		Let's smoke some shit
