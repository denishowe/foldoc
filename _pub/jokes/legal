>>        Disorder in the Court: a Collection of 'Transquips' by
>>   Richard Lederer
>>
>>   Most language is spoken language, and most words, once they are
>>   uttered, vanish forever into the air.  But such is not the case
>>   with language spoken during courtroom trials, for there exists an
>>   army of courtroom reporters whose job it is to take down and
>>   preserve every statement made during the proceedings.
>>
>>   Mary Louise Gilman, the venerable editor of the National Shorthand
>>   Reporter has collected many of the more hilarious courtroom
>>   bloopers in two books - Humor in the Court (1977) and More Humor
>>   in the Court, published a few months ago. From Mrs. Gilman's two
>>   volumes, here are some of my favorite transquips, all recorded by
>>   America's keepers of the word:

>>        Q.  He's been your brother-in-law for years, and you can't
>>            remember his first name?
>>        A.  No.  I tell you I'm too excited. (Rising from the witness
>>            chair and pointing to Mr. Borofkin.) Nathan, for God's sake,
>>            tell them your first name!

>>
