 INTRODUCTION

 This file documents methods of sending mail from one network to another.
 It represents the aggregate knowledge of the readers of comp.mail.misc
 and many contributors elsewhere.  If you know of any corrections or
 additions to this file, please follow the instructions in the section
 entitled 'HOW TO FORMAT INFORMATION FOR SUBMISSION' and then mail the
 information to me: Scott A. Yanoff <yanoff@csd4.csd.uwm.edu>. 

 HOW TO USE THIS GUIDE

 If you just want to browse the guide manually for information, this is what
 you need to know.  The guide is organized as a list of entries.  Each entry
 tells you how to get from one network to another.  Here is what a typical
 entry might look like:

   FROM: mynet
   TO: yournet
   RECIPIENT: youraddress
   CONTACT: contactaddress
   INSTR: send to 'youraddress@thegateway'

 This means that to send mail FROM a network called 'mynet' TO a
 RECIPIENT address 'youraddress' on a network called 'yournet', you
 should follow the INSTRUCTIONS shown and address your mail to
 'youraddress@thegateway'.

 The 'RECIPIENT' record gives an example of an address on the
 destination network, to make it clear in subsequent lines what text
 requires subsitution.

 The 'CONTACT' record gives an address for inquiries concerning the
 gateway, expressed as an address reachable from the source (#FROM:) network.
 Presumably, if you can't get the gateway to work at all, then knowing
 an unreachable address on another network will not be of great help.

 The 'INSTR' records, of which there may be several, give verbal
 instructions to a user of the source network to let them send mail
 to a user on the destination network.  Text that needs to be typed
 will appear in double quotes, with C-style escapes if necessary.  If
 the instructions consist simply of mailing to a certain address, this
 will be indicated by the words 'send to' followed by a quoted address.
 If there are alternative addresses, they will be marked 'or to' instead.

 HOW TO FORMAT INFORMATION FOR SUBMISSION

 Here is what I really want in the way of information.  If you are adding
 a new network to the list, tell me what its official name is (pay attention
 to capitalization), what the name of its responsible organization is, and
 what kind of a network it is (academic, commercial, government, in-house
 or non-profit).  If this isn't clear, look at the examples above.
 For each connection, give me an entry that looks something like:

  FROM: foonet
  TO: barnet
  RECIPIENT: baraddress
  CONTACT: contactaddress
  INSTR: send to 'baraddress@thegateway'

 Note that 'contactaddress' must be an address expressed in foonet's native
 format, and not that of barnet, since if a user is having trouble accessing
 barnet, giving him/her an address on that net to contact for help is not
 productive.  If there is no contact/postmaster address, please tell me.
 If there are more complicated instructions, use additional #INSTR: lines.

 Once you've got all the information together, send it to me in an e-mail
 message with the words 'INMG update' in the Subject: line.  You can in
 general expect an answer back from me within a week.

RECIPIENT: user@domain
INSTR: Methods for sending mail from Bitnet to the Internet vary depending on
-      what mail software is running at the Bitnet site in question.  In the
-      best case, users should simply be able to send mail to 'user@domain'.
-      If this doesn't work, try 'user%domain@gateway' where 'gateway' is a
-      Bitnet-Internet gateway site nearby.  Finally, if neither of these
-      works, you may have to try hand-coding an SMTP envelope for your mail.
