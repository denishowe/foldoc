     The definition of "defenestration" in the FOLDOC contains the
phrase "the traditional Czechoslovakian method of assassinating prime 
ministers". This phrase contains several errors. 

     Historically, there were two Defenestrations of Prague - in 1419
and 1618.  In 1419, Prague was the capital of the Kingdom of Bohemia,
and in 1618 it was the capital of the province of Bohemia in the
Habsburg Empire.  The Republic of Czechoslovakia did not exist until
the end of World War I.

     In the First Defenstration of Prague in 1419, 7 members of the
Prague city council were thrown out of the windows of the town hall
and impaled on pikes held by the mob below. 

     The Second Defenstration of Prague in 1618 was not fatal.  Some
accounts say the victims landed on a pile of mud, some say a pile 
of garbage, others say a pile of manure.  At any rate, all accounts
seem to agree that there were no fatalities.  Some references say that
the 2 Imperial representatives were accompanied by their secretary in
their flight through the window, but most ignore the secretaries.

     It is clear that none of the victims of these incidents were prime
ministers, and only one involved fatalities.

     I suggest that you remove the phrase "the traditional
Czechoslovakian method of assassinating prime ministers" from the
FOLDOC definition and replace it with "the traditional Bohemian method
of disposing of unwanted politicians".
Regards,

Bob
