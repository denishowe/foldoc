If anyone is interested in getting onto compuserve from the internet
I have found a internet gateway for it

telnet to hermes.merit.edu

and when it requests a host type

compuserve

It then asks for a compuserve login id (ie you still need an account)

Just thought someone might like to know....

Mike.
