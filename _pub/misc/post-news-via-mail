Recently some people have been posting news through other benevolent users
because their local systems do not permit them to post news.

I thought it might be useful to point out to such people (in case they are
not aware of this) that anyone who can send electronic mail can post news
to comp.sys.acorn.

All you have to do is email the news to comp-sys-acorn@ucbvax.berkeley.edu
as a standard electronic mail message. Your message will be converted into
a news file and posted onto Usenet (ie will appear in comp.sys.acorn).

This system is not ideal, in that you can't easily quote other users, and
can't cross reference articles, but it does mean that you don't have to
bother someone else. Despite the fact that your message is going to USA and
back, the item generally appears in news within a day or two.

I had to use this recently when our news posting program refused to work.

Hope that this will be of use to someone!
