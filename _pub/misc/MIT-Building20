kluge

I notice that in the entry for kluge, a reference is made to the TMRC existing in the Venerable Building 20. This should be changed to the past tense as said venerable building was closed down in 1998 and completely demolished in 1999. Originally built as a millitary barracks for the development of Radar and other such projects during WWII, building 20 was only intended as a temporary structure to last a few years. It had become an asbestos as well as architectural hazard, and its demise came about 40 years later than it should have. The Tech Model Railroad Club is now located in Building N52.
