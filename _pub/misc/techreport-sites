Last-modified: 1993-09-30

[ note: postings for comp.doc.techreports should go to
compdoc-techreports-request@ftp.cse.ucsc.edu, not to me -rik ]

Here is my list of sites that appear to distribute technical reports.
It is not very complete, or up to date, but would appreciate any input
anyone can give me to make this list more useful.  I would like to
thank everyone who has sent in their site's techreports archives (keep
them coming).  In particular, I want to thank the following people for
sending me their personal lists:

   Natalie Sipes <sipes@cs.unc.edu>
   Bob Krovetz <krovetz@hobart.cs.umass.edu>
   Ralph Berg <ralph@first.gmd.de>
   Alf-Christian Achilles <achilles@ira.uka.de>

Thank you also to the Department of Robotics and Digital Technology,
who are supplying the disk space and CPU power for the archives.

There are now over 200 sites in the sites list.

I have put together an archive of University technical reports
(abstracts and title lists, not the reports).  If you have any lists or
abstracts of University techreports (or other Research type papers) I
would love to hear from you.  I have now collected information for 
over 10,000 technical reports.  Over 2,300 of these reports have full
abstracts.

If you are willing to put your data in the form I use in my database,
as specified in:
   ftp.rdt.monash.edu.au:/pub/techreports/reports/README
or it is easily converted (refer, or many other field-oriented
formats), and can be made available for ftp, then your data can be
automatically inserted into the database without any user
intervention.  This means you don't have to wait for me to add your
files, and the data will always be up-to-date.  Send me some mail if
you are interested.

I have available most of the archive I am currently working on.  To
access this, anonymous ftp to ftp.rdt.monash.edu.au, and look in the
directory pub/techreports.  Any comments, questions, etc to me.

Please don't mail to these people (or me) asking for technical reports
that are not on this list or "some information about the blah-blah-blah
discipline."  We do what we can to make reports available.  If it's not
on this list, then I probably don't have any information on it.

For all ftp sites, unless noted otherwise, log in as 'anonymous', or
'ftp' and give your email address as the password.
