1) What is Archie ?                                                             
                                                                                
        Archie is an experimental search engine and database for locating       
sources on the Internet. In other words, if you know what you are looking for   
and it is not on your system, then archie provides a way to find out where      
you can get the file from.                                                      
                                                                                
        There are many ways of accessing archie. If there's an archie client    
running on your machine, then all you need to do is type "archie" and it will   
show you the syntax of the command.  Otherwise you may telnet to                
archie.ans.net and login as archie and follow the instructions.                 
                                                                                
------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
                                                                                
2) What is telnet ?                                                             
                                                                                
        Telnet is used to communicate with another host computer using the      
telnet protocol. For example, if I would like to use the University of Mich.    
weather underground service, I would type                                       
        % telnet downwind.sprl.umich.edu 3000                                   
The most common use of telnet is to login to another machine which also has     
telnet software.  Telnet is not operating system dependant.                     
                                                                                
------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
                                                                                
3) What is FTP ?                                                                
                                                                                
        FTP stands for File Transfer Protocol, and as its name implies it is    
used to transfer files from one computer to another connected over a network.   
For exmple, if you have an account on a machine and would like to get or put    
your file there, then you would type                                            
        %ftp <name.of.your.machine>                                             
and at the password prompt, type in your password and then type "get file" to   
obtain a file and "put file" to transfer a file there. Typing ftp without the   
address of the machine would go into its command mode and have a "ftp>" prompt. 
To get help at that prompt type "?".                                            
                                                                                
------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
                                                                                
4) What are USENET/BITNET/FREENET/FIDONET/UUNET ?                               
                                                                                
USENET:                                                                         
                                                                                
USENET is the set of machines that exchange articles tagged with one or         
more universally-recognized labels, called newsgroups.

BITNET:                                                                         
                                                                                
BITnet (Because It's Time Network) is a service of CREN (Corporation for        
Research and Educational Networking) and consists of computers called nodes     
at many locations including major educational, research, and corporate          
institutions in all 50 states and 32 foreign countries. Using BITnet will       
enable one to communicate electronically with users at any of the other         
member institutions.

FREENET:                                                                        
                                                                                
Freenets are open-access, free, community computer systems. One such system     
is the Cleveland Freenet. sponsored by CWRU (Case Western Reserve               
University). Anyone and everyone is welcome to join and take part in the        
exciting project -...... There's no charge for the registration process and

FIDONET:                                                                        
                                                                                
An e-mail group of bbs operators.  They operate somewhat like a                 
usenet group with various echoes or conferences on different subjects.          
People call their local BBS with fidonet and leave messages.  The local         
BBS relays these messages to the net so there is world-wide distribution.       
This is by phone-line and not instantaneous like an internet connection.        
                                                                                
Mail routing is normally done for 1 hour each day.  Thus, it sometimes takes    
quite a while for messages to travel long distances.  But, the system is        
pretty cheap, so many BBSes are starting to offer it.  You may become a "point" 
off of your local fidonet BBS by just asking the sysop.  When you're a point,   
you can receive mail directed to you personally (like having your own           
internet/bitnet address).  Until then, you can just read the echoes, which are  
basically just discussion groups under Fidonet.                                 
                                                                                
To send mail from the Internet you need the Fidonet zone, area and node         
Check my signature file below notice that format for fidonet mail.  If you      
want to mail to someone you need that number on the lesft which you then        
translate to the format on the right.........Good luck!

UUNET:                                                                          
                                                                                
UUNET is basically the collection of hosts which connect the internet via       
modem connections and UUCP software.  Its a poor mans internet.  Often          
Usenet news is transferred to some sites via UUCP.

5) What are *.tar files and what can we do with them ?                          
                                                                                
        *.tar files are tape archive files that are in an archived format to    
be stored on tape or some other medium. They allow one to store may files,      
directories and subdirectories in just one file. Usually they are compressed    
*.tar.Z and one has to first uncompress (using %uncompress <name>) them         
and then                                                                        
                                                                                
        prompt% tar -xvf name.tar                                               
                                                                                
to extract the files from the tar file. The option x is for extraction, v is    
for verbose and f is for file name (rather than a tape device).                 
If you need more detailed information do a man tar.

6) How can we get to compuserve/MCI mail from the internet ?                    
                                                                                
COMPUSERVE:                                                                     
                                                                                
To e-mail to someone who has a compuserve account from the internet,            
you should just type mail account_number@compuserve.com at the prompt. For      
example, if you know that the account # is 12345,6789 then                      
                                                                                
        prompt% mail 12345,6789@compuserve.com                                  
                                                                                
would do. To access compuserve through the internet, telnet to hermes.merit.edu 
and type compuserve at the prompt. There is a fee for this internet access      
which gets added to your compuserve bill.                                       
                                                                                
MCIMAIL:                                                                        
                                                                                
A basic mailbox for MCIMail is $35.00 per year and allows unlimited             
receipt of Internet mail. So getting that file to my Mac cost me just the       
dime a day basic mailbox charge from MCI!  Call MCIMail at 1-800-444-6245       
if you want more info on this.

7) What is the LISTSERV service ?                                               
                                                                                
        Listservs are programs that act as distribution centers for mail        
messages and documents.  These lists generally focus on a specific topic,       
often indicated by the name of a list.                                          
                                                                                
Almost anyone can access a general listserv.  Some listservs, due to nature of  
the topics that they cover, are restricted access, and a prospective subscriber 
must apply for access.  Listservs are handled via the BITNET links.  Many       
internet users also are able to access Listservs via various gateways.          
                                                                                
There are a number of commands you can send to listserv which will give you     
information about a list.  To review listserv commands send e-mail to           
listserv@vm.temple.edu (which is the one you seem to know), and in the body     
of your mail type:                                                              
                                                                                
GET LISTSERV REFCARD                                                            
                                                                                
Listserv will send you a reference card of its commands.  Pay particular        
attention to the LIST command which is how you get information about lists.     
                                                                                
You can obtain a list of the  available archive files by sending an "INDEX      
HELP-NET" command to LISTSERV@TEMPLEVM.  These files  can  then  be retrieved   
by  means  of a  "GET HELP-NET  filetype"  command,  or  using  the  database   
search  facilities  of LISTSERV. Send an "INFO DATABASE" command for more       
information on the latter.                                                      
                                                                                
  More  information  on  LISTSERV  commands   can  be  found  in  the  "General 
Introduction  guide", which  you can  retrieve  by sending  an "INFO  GENINTRO" 
command to LISTSERV@TEMPLEVM.                                                   
                                                                                
------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
                                                                                
8) How can I find someone's e-mail address ?                                    
                                                                                
        To find someone's email address, the best thing to do is to find the    
address directly from that person. If you cannot do this, then try the whois    
database of nic.ddn.mil which has the addresses of many military personnel, as  
well as some prominent net personalities. To do this type                       
                                                                                
                %prompt whois <name>                                            
                                                                                
If you dont have a "whois" program on your system then you can telnet to        
nic.ddn.mil and run the command "whois" once you are logged in. Help is         
available.                                                                      
                                                                                
Also, you can use the "netfind" service provided by telneting to                
bruno.cs.colorado.edu and login as netfind.  Menus guide you through            
the process.                                                                    
                                                                                
------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
                                                                                
9) What are the *.gif files and how can we view them ?                          
                                                                                
        GIF stands for Compuserve's Graphic Interchange Format. It is a         
format for storing images. In order to view these *.gif files, one can either   
get a gif viewing utility for pc's or view them using xv,xgif,xloadimage on     
X-stations.                                                                     
                                                                                
------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
                                                                                
10) How can you add "signatures" to your mail ?                                 
                                                                                
        If you are using elm mailer on unix systems, then all you have 1)  put  
your signature in a .signature file using a text editor and 2) modify your      
elmrc file so that the parameters "localsignature" and remote "signature" are   
set to the right files.                                                         
                                                                                
        To add a signature automatically to outgoing mail in CMS, use the new   
mail92 feature. When you type mail92 <name@addr> you will get into a screen     
which has the options menu on the title bar. In the "Options" menu, choose      
"send" and then "settings" and change the "Signature?" option to "automatic",   
and the "Signature File" option to the name of your signature file.             
                                                                                
------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
                                                                                
11) Interactive commands (Tell, write, talk)                                    
                                                                                
        Tell is the command that is used on CMS machines to write a message     
to the terminal of aother user who is also logged on to the system. The syntax  
                                                                                
        TELL userid message                                                     
                                                                                
is as shown above. It will write a one-line message if the other user is        
logged in. On unix systems the command is                                       
                                                                                
        write username <tty> message                                            
        [Control-D]                                                             
                                                                                
The above command will write a message until you type <Control-D> on a line     
by itself. The tty is necessary if the user is logged in more than once.        
To "talk" to another user do just that. Just type %talk username <tty>

12) What are gopher, irc ?                                                      
                                                                                
        IRC is an full-screen interface to the internet relay chat system.      
It lets people talk to others around the world who are on the internet through  
specialized interest groups.                                                    
                                                                                
     The Internet Gopher is a distributed document delivery service.  It        
allows a neophyte user to access various types of data residing on multiple     
hosts in a seamless fashion.  This is accomplished by presenting the user a     
hierarchicalarrangement of documents and by using a client-server communi-      
cations model.  The Internet Gopher Server accepts simple queries, and          
responds by sending the client a document. Gophers frequently include such      
services as archive ftp searches, on-line books through project gutenberg,      
News and Phone directories of many universities.

A list of the currently available mailing lists is available in at least        
two places: the first is in a file on ftp.nisc.sri.com called 'interest-groups' 
under the netinfo/ directory.  It's upadated fairly regularly, but is large     
(around 840K), so only get it every once in a while.  The other list is         
maintained by Gene Spafford and is posted in parts to the newsgroup news.lists  
semi-regularly"                                                                 
                                                                                
--------------------------------------------------------------------------      
                                                                                
14) VMS, BITFTP, and those pesky binary files.                                  
                                                                                
     Well I found this to be a significant problem, also. The help file         
the BITFTP@PUCC ships out tells you about how to fix it. I personally           
found this rather tedious, so I decided to automate the process by              
writing a small DCL program to do it for me (I am lazy by nature).              
                                                                                
     The problem has to do with the VMS carriage_control attribute              
getting mangled when the file is sent through other computer types. It          
MUST be 'none' for the file to be usable on a PC or a MVS machine.              
                                                                                
     The DCL program does it all for you! Once the file that you                
requested from BITFTP@PUCC gets into your RECEIVE directory -- you would        
type --> @FB. Then it'll create and/or move to a directory called [.FB]         
and do all of it's work there -- heck it even cleans up it's mess. The          
only problem with it is that you need double the room of the file, but          
you would if you were doing it by hand. The process has to make a               
brand-new file. Sorry, I can't do anything about it.....                        
                                                                                
     The program also has more 'how-to' info (1 or 2 pages inside the file)     
than the actual code that does the conversion (about 26 lines). You may         
feel free to contact me if you have any difficulties with it.                   
                                                                                
The command to get this DCL program is (VMS)                                    
                                                                                
        send listserv@templevm get fb com help-net                              
                                                                                
I hope that it helps you fokls out!
