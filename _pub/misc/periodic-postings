Many newsgroups contain articles which are posted on a periodic basis.
These articles tend to be useful for both novice and experienced
users, as they usually fall into one of these categories:

    1. How-to articles explaining some of the basics and fine
    points of network usage, etiquette, standards, etc.

    2. Introductory notes about one or more newsgroups, covering
    policies (if any) for submissions to that group, usage, etc.
    Common questions and answers pertinent to a newsgroup(s).

    3. Indexes of archives, or pointers to archives for various
    groups.  Periodic newsletters, calendars, pointers to
    publications.

    4. Statistical information and reports about Usenet; tables of
    Usenet hosts, links, etc.

    5. Miscellany, including small useful sources, "fun" lists, and so
    on.

This is a list of the periodic postings known at this time; each
posting is listed in an entry that includes who posts the article,
which newsgroup(s) it appears in, what "Subject" line is used, and how
often the article is posted.  The list is sorted by the "Newsgroups"
line.  The character '*' is used as a wildcard, e.g. "v*INF1" matches
"v01INF1", "v02INF1", etc.

The "Date" line of a posting's entry indicates, where given, when the
posting last appeared.  However, it may be inaccurate if (a) the
maintainer of the posting has changed the "Subject" line, or (b) the
most recent version has not reached my site, or (c) the entry actually
corresponds to multiple postings because of wildcarding.

The "Archive-name" line of a posting's entry indicates, where given,
the archive name that appeared in the posting when it was last posted.
Note that if one entry matches multiple postings because of
wildcarding, then only one archive name will appear.

Corrections and additions (via MAIL) are most welcome.  New entries
for the list should be submitted in the same form as the entries
below, with From, Newsgroups, Subject, Frequency, and (optionally)
Comments lines, in that order.

>From the summer of 1989, when this list was created, until February,
1992, it was maintained by Rich Kulawiec <rsk@gynko.circ.upenn.edu>.
He has handed it over to me because my position as moderator of
news.answers makes it easier for me to keep track of periodic
informational postings, and because he would like to devote more time
and energy to other efforts.

Several archives of USENET periodic informational postings exist.  To
find out more about them and how to access them, see the posting
entitled "Introduction to news.answers" in the news.answers newsgroup.
If you do not know how to get that newsgroup and/or your site does not
receive it and/or that article has expired in it, you can retrieve it
via anonymous ftp from pit-manager.mit.edu [18.172.1.27] in the file
/pub/usenet/news.answers/news-answers-intro.  If you do not have
access to anonymous ftp, you can retrieve it by sending a mail message
to mail-server@pit-manager.mit.edu with the command "send
usenet/news.answers/news-answers-intro" in the message.
