Dear Mr Howe,

In answer to your question about the Earth's irregular rotation, I'll
say "many things", some of which are:

1. Torque caused by the Moon.

2. Atmospheric movement, drag etc.

3. Oceanic movement. This is somewhat related to...

4. The weather, including El Niño. (The Pacific Ocean is USUALLY on a
tilt with the western edge about 20 centimetres higher than its
eastern edge [caused by wind flow]. When El Niño 'kicks in', the
Pacific levels off thus reducing its drag on the Earth below. This
allows the planet to speed up.)

5. A seasonal effect (not fully understood, by any one) which allows
the Earth to spin fast around August and slow around April or May each
year.

6. Core-mantle 'slippage' and other crustal movements, etc.

7. Polar motion, connected partially to No. 1 above. The North Pole is
never stationary, but travels an erratic spiral path roughly down 80
degrees West longitude. The tighter the spiral, the faster the
rotation (the balleria syndrome). This spiral is referred to as the
'Chandler Wobble' which has 2 components, one being that of No. 5
above resulting in a near-circular motion with a diameter of about 6
metres in 12 months and another (No. 6 above) with a diameter of 3 to
15 metres with a period of about 428 days. Consequently, these 2
components can either work together or against each other. There is a
third cyclic motion that has a period of some 600 years (not fully
observed) which not much is known about.

The following are annual mean lengths of day in milliseconds in excess
of 24 (atomic) hours, since 1971:

1971, 2.90;  1972, 3.13;  1973, 3.05;  1974, 2.72;  1975, 2.69; 
1976, 2.91;  1977, 2.77;  1978, 2.88;  1979, 2.61;  1980, 2.30;  1981,
2.16;  1982, 2.16;  1983, 2.28;  1984, 1.52;  1985 ,  1.45;  1986,
1.23;  1987,  1.36;  1988, 1.32;  1989, 1.53;  1990, 1.94;  1991, 2.04
;  1992, 2.22;  1993, 2.37;  1994, 2.17;  1995, 2.31;  1996, 1.83; 
1997, 1.84;  1998, 1.37;  1999, 0.99; 2000 (provisional), 0.72; 12
months ending 02/08/2001 (provisional), 0.61.

The value to remember is 2.74 = the loss of 1 second a year.  Over the
past month, the Earth has GAINED 0.17 milliseconds per day on average;
about 5.3 milliseconds in the month.

Perhaps an even better wording would be: "allowing for the
eccentricity of the Earth's orbit, the rotational axis tilt (23.5
degrees), but still showing the Earth's irregular rotation, on which
UT1 is based."

I trust that this answers the question.
