            EUnet GB News Announcement - 2   07/04/93

EUnet GB - New name, familiar standards

UKnet, the  provider  of  electronic  mail,  news  and  full
Internet  access  to  over  800  UK sites, is now trading as
EUnet GB, confirming its role as founder member and also  as
the British backbone of the independently run EUnet Europe.

The scope of EUnet Europe extends  to  26  countries  across
Europe and North Africa connecting about 3000 organisations,
generating over 100000 electronic mail items per  day. EUnet
Europe   maintains  dedicated  high   volume  gateways  into
America through  the  network  hub  in  Amsterdam,  mutually
backed up by NORDUnet's American gateway.

Costs for UK organisations remain low since the overhead  of
running the extensive network backbone is shared between all
our customers. Typical customer access  is  via  a  64kb/sec
leased line installed and managed by EUnnet GB.

All the existing name forms will be supported in  the  short
to medium term, but we actively encourage you to use the
        user@Britain.EU.net
form for all future correspondence. This fits  in  with  the
general  EUnet Europe model with all backbones conforming to
a common naming scheme
