<div id="all-lyrics">
Sound out the galleon to travel to cross
Close the space between pastures As rightly attained
As old stands to plunder
Expectant as one dear companion can utter
The right we achieve

Climb summer mornings and tell me of days past
Did we all to sing of the praises of love
And is one hand raised high in the dark

Total relating appointed close factors
Of what we regard as the answer lies there
And is one hand raised high in the dark

There stands Olias to outward to build a ship
Holding within all we hope to retain
The frame will be so built to challenge the universe
Clasped with the skins of the fish of the plain

Mastered volcano erupt with the pleasure
And sing to the power, we will sail to the East
And all hands shall rise to the call

Sighting our vision Ranyart will precision us
From all our points to our destined recall
And shall all but rejoice to it all

There stands Qoquaq and shall point to the four corners
Reaching out faster shall overtake you
To bring you to safety to travel away
From this moment that's rightly attained as your view

So sound out the galleon to travel to cross
Close the space between pastures
As rightly attained As old stands to plunder
Expectant as one dear companion can offer The right we achieve

Olias awoke from a dream and drank his soul into the ocean
That sailed past the brink of his window that long summer

Then build the ship the Moorglade Mover
To sail a silence which nobody knows

Olias shines as clear as his sons emotions retrace him
As one delivers always one will shine over you

I've sailed and always will to parts of Sunhillow
Ride on Olias remember your begotten father

I've trailed and sailed a silence which nobody knows
Ride on Olias remember your begotten sons

To move we delight Call his name, his name
We chase as we run The motion decide

O lend a clear light We motion the stars
Call his name, his name We chase as we run
To move we delight Call his name, his name
We chase a clear light The ocean decide

O motion the stars Call his name, his name, his name

First we hold your hand As we lay Silent As the dawn

Words are told your eyes We will stay Silent As the dawn

And the slightest confrontation
Was dissolved before the start
Each man Belonged To each as one clear hand
Asking only comfort creation He divided to the least
Each man Open Set sights to new lands

And do remember you The first to venture
First to gain Exploring daylight
Clearer than the Talloplanic views

And there they were inside
The Moorglade to move and to chant
All through force to position

As rhythm raced inside the ship came alive
And was struck to the soul of perception

And raised our head to space
Beyond all the mass and the mountains
The sun they were headed

Word of life rejoice the sunlight
Course the flower to open wide
Open They ride Climb into the dark sky

Such a moment kindly lingered
They set sail from Tallowcross

(A light to lead you
Is taken from the massland to the East
As words are spoken
All courage be the token
As the feast)

Wide eyed removing The precious moment we have seen

Hold my life Cross the path
Course and curl my dreams away

Fast the soul Make the break
As even as the stars that form the way

Turn a mountain send them lost
Among the flowers of the young

Hold my life Cross the path
Course and curl my dreams away

Fast the soul Make the break
As even as the stars that form the way

Worlds that lie between
Are simply seconds of words we do not mean
Cast a pastel sky
Or simply wonder until the day you die

Eyes have never seen
So pass your future caressing all you've been

All you say All you dreamed All memory awaken
Olias all surrounding the storm
To caress all who fall Amidst, loves light
So brightly to each tribe came release
Higher dreams o'er took the smallest hands
Crystallized inside a sleep
Close your eyes Only wait for the call
The Moorglade she will sail to the north
All around will delight our eyes
Now as one We'll sound our lives to the sun
As we wait for the call To ascend to the stars
All to enter your heart To your love

Through change of dawn
See, peace will come Peace will reign
All along our days See your love

Hold come a day dream Ask a flower to kneel
When you pray to the runner

Spurn all ye kindle And cradle his sweet pleasure
As you just look Farther and farther beyond him
Call for the giver, the taker
Rejoicing As you just look Farther and farther beyond him
Spurn all ye kindle and cradle his sweet pleasure

In it all To the devil take
