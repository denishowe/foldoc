 To remove the clash with the Interface Manager, the validation
strings were changed (and extended) for RISC OS 3, version 3.10:

 r1     raised slab, no action on clicking
 r2     dropped slab, no action on clicking
 r3     raised ridge, no action on clicking           } good for grouping
 r4     dropped ridge (gutter), no action on clicking } icons together
 r5     raised slab, drops and changes colour on clicking
 r6     "default" type slabbing, drops and changes colour on clicking
 r7     writeable icon slabbing

--Fil.

Now that Acorn have battened down the RISC OS 3.10 hatches, it should be
OK to post this without the numbers changing on us!

Here are the validation strings for providing slabbed (plinthy) borders
just *inside* the boundary of icons under RISC OS 3.10:
  
  R0: no slabbing
  R1: slabbed up - no action on clicking
  R2: slabbed down - no action on clicking
  R3: ridge grouping icon
  R4: ditch grouping icon
  R5: slabbed up - slabs down automatically on clicking
  R6: default icon - slabs down automatically on clicking
  R7: writeable icon

As with RISC OS 3, version 3.00, it is possible to define alternative
slabbing down colours.
