Hi Denis,

In my Acorn MIDI Interface User's Guide the fast clock
is mentioned as a fourth method for giving a MIDI event
a time reference. It is recommended by Acorn for using it
in new applications. It is accessed by means of the following
SYS call:

SYS "MIDI_FastClock" {,RO,R1}

o with R0 < 0 read current value of fast clock. Result in R0.
  So after SYS "MIDI_FastClock",-1,0 TO ,R% the variable R%
  contains the value of fastclock.
o R0 > 0 resets the value of fastclock to the value in,
  I believe (the user's guide is at my home), R1 and 
  starts the fast clock. After this call the MIDI
  events, which are received by the two calls below,
  are data stamped by means of fast clock.

The fast clock is updated every millisecond (1/1000 s) !
It is meant to be used with the calls:

SYS "MIDI_RxCommand" {,R0,R1} Receive command
SYS "MIDI_TxCommand" {,R0,R1} Transmit command

These two calls are compatible:

o R0 contains the MIDI event:
   - byte 0 contains byte #1 \
   - byte 1 contains byte #2  | the MIDI event
   - byte 2 contains byte #3 /
   - byte 3 contains the number of bytes of the MIDI event
     for instance: 144 76 64 (note on, 3 bytes)
                   192 1      (program change, 2 bytes)
o R1 contains the time stamp. Thus in this case the value
  of fast clock.

So if are receiving a MIDI event with
 SYS "MIDI_RxCommand" TO event%,timing%
it is transmitted and SCHEDULED with:
 SYS "MIDI_TxCommand",event%,timing%

This menas that you don't have to use SYS "Sound_QSchedule"
in order to schedule SYS "MIDI_TxByte" (I believe you
have used these SYS calls.) The fast clock uses timer 1
of the IOC chip in your Archimedes. This means that if other
application are also using this timer, this could lead to
clashes.

You told me that the fast clock facility is never mentioned
in your user's guide. Does this mean that you have a very
old version of Acorn's MIDI podule ? I believe that
my version of the MIDI firmware (the MIDI software in the ROM
on the podule PCB) is version 3.14 or something and is dated
somewhere in 1989. I bought it from my dealer in march 1992.
But it is stated that the fast clock, which was in the
previous version not always working correctly, is improved.
I don't know what type of Archimedes you have, but the
MIDI User's Guide is the same for both the A3000 and
A300/310 and A410/420/440 (and perhaps the A5000) machines.
This means that the MIDI podule is working the same for
all machines. So according to me your MIDI interface
should have the fast clock facility or you should have
a very,very old version of the MIDI podule.

I think you can test whether the fast clock is available
by running ArcMidi, opening the record window,
(Show -> Record in the main menu), Creating a pattern by
pressing the menu button in the record window and use the
Pattern->Create option. Type in a name for the pattern 
6 characters long) and click OK. Then click somewhere
in the record window to remove the menu. Next click on
the name of the pattern in the pattern list (it will be
highlighted) and click on the record button in the left
upper corner of the record window. If you have the fast
clock facililty built in your MIDI podule, the clock
(Pos.) in the record window should be running and you
press a key on your keyboard in the left upper corner
of the desktop, the received MIDI events are printed.
The last number is the value of the time stamp (fast clock).

So please let me know if the fast clock facility is working
with your Archimedes. If not, perhaps I should change my
program ?? If you find my summary of the MIDI fast clock
interesting, I think you can sent it to Greg O'Sullivan.
(or post it to comp.sys.acorn ???).

Loek.
