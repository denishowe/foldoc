This extract comes from the latest issue of Electronics Times (25/2/93)

ARM has revealed details of its next generation risc core, the ARM 7.
Apple is among those expected to use it in future generations of handheld
products.

The Arm 7 processor core will use half the power of the existing offering,
the ARM 6, and will be around half the die size. In a full processor
design
it should provide 50% to 100% more performance, according to Robin Saxby,
managing director of ARM.

Saxby said a new processor based on the ARM 7 core would be launched in
the second half of the year: "We know the ARM 7 core will work, but the
ARM700 processor with bigger caches we haven't taped out yet."

He said the ARm 6 core in 5v 1um CMOS used 33,500 transistors in 11.1 sqmm
A shrink to 5v 0.8um CMOS reduced the area to 5.4 sq mm, and cut power by
20%. ARM added 2000 transistors to the core to stabilise 3.3v operation,
increasing its area to 5.9 sq mm. Saxby said the ARM 7 core would be
36,000 transistors, and at 3.3v would use half the power of the 5v ARM 6
core.

                        ARM hand strengthened


     ARM has revealed details of its next generation risc core, the
     Arm7.  Apple is among those expected to use it in future
     generations of handheld products.

     The Arm7 processor core will use half the power of the existing
     offering, the Arm6, and will be around half the die size.  In a
     full processor design it should provide 50 to 100% more
     performance, according to Robin Saxby, managing director of ARM.

     Saxby said a new processor based on the Arm7 core would launch in
     the second half of the year: "We know the Arm7 core will work,
     but the Arm700 processor with bigger caches we haven't taped out
     yet."

     He said the Arm6 core in 5V 1µm cmos used 33,500 transistors in
     11.1 sq mm.  A shrink to 5V 0.8µm cmos reduced the area to 5.4 sq
     mm, and cut power by 20%.  ARM added 2000 transistors to the core
     to stabilise 3.3V operation, increasing its area to 5.9 sq mm. 
     Saxby said the Arm7 core would be 36,000 transistors, and at 3.3V
     would use half the power of the 5V Arm6 core.

     "The first implementation of the Arm7 will be in the Arm700,"
     Saxby added.  "The performance improvement of the Arm700 over the
     Arm610 will be 50 to 100%.

     "We have to keep pushing performance up and power consumption
     down," Saxby continued.  "Making the right trade-iffs is our
     skill."

     Saxby is beginning a concerted move into the Japanese market by
     opening a sales and support office on Monday.

     "Our remote offices are co-ordination and collaboration offices
     with partners," said Saxby.  "We'll also use them to keep our
     eyes and ears (sic!) to the ground."  A business development
     manager has been appointed and trained by the company.  "One of
     his jobs will be to communicate with our design partners."
