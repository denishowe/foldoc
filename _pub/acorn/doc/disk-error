As requested, details of the ST506 error codes. Note that not all of the
possible errors are listed, since they are largely related to driving the
chip itself. Instead, only those related to disc or data errors are given:
  
  Value         Meaning
  &07           Write fault has been detected on the ST506 interface
  &08           Drive not ready
  &09           Seek did not complete before timeout
  &10           Error correction code (ECC) detected an error
  &11           CRC error in data area
  &12           ECC corrected an error (would this be trapped by ADFS?)
  &13           Fatal ECC error in data area
  &16           ID not found within timeout
  &17           ID area started with an improper address mark
  &18           Missing address mark
  &19           Drive write protected
  
Obviously, some of the above should NEVER appear since they correspond to
fault hardware or a badly formatted drive.

Hope this helps.
