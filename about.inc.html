<h2 class="clear">The Free On-line Dictionary of Computing</h2>

<p>URL: http://foldoc.org/</p>

<p>The Free On-line Dictionary of Computing (FOLDOC) is a searchable
dictionary of acronyms, jargon, programming languages, tools,
architectures, operating systems, networking, theory, mathematics,
telecoms, institutions, companies, projects, products,
history, in fact anything related to computing.</p>

<p>It aims to provide a one-stop source of information about all
computing terms and includes many useful cross-references and
pointers to related resources elsewhere on the Internet, as well as
bibliographical references to paper publications.  It lacks many
entries which one can find in paper computing dictionaries but
contains more encyclopedia-like entries and entries on subjects
such as current hardware and software products, companies,
and institutions.</p>

<p>FOLDOC is maintained by me, Denis Howe, in my "copious
spare time" as a free service.  It is served from a
<a href="https://www.bitcatcha.com/hosting-reviews/">Linux web server</a>
provided for a pittance by <a href="https://www.scaleway.com/">Scaleway</a>.</p>

<h2>How does it work?</h2>

<p>The dictionary is stored as a single source file in a simple,
easy-to-edit, human-readable form of mark-up which is converted to
HTML on the fly by a Perl CGI program. The program uses a custom
matching algorithm to provide fast, flexible, indexed searches of
headings.  Other Perl programs build the index, the lists of missing
terms, and the contents pages.</p>

<h2>History</h2>

<p>The dictionary started in 1985 and has grown, with the help of 2000
contributors, to contain nearly 15,000 definitions.  It receives
around 10,000 unique visitors per month.</p>

<p><a href="missing.html">A list of frequently requested missing
terms</a> is available.  Users are encouraged to contribute
definitions of missing terms.  These contributions are usually edited
extensively before inclusion.  New terms are added occasionally.</p>

<p>I started the dictionary in 1985 by copying half a dozen definitions
from a magazine article for my own use.	 It grew slowly until I came
to Imperial in 1990 and discovered the Internet and the wonderful
world of anonymous FTP.	 I found several major sources of definitions
out on the net, most notably the On-line Hacker Jargon File, but
nothing you could call a dictionary of computing.	 I knocked up a few
sed, awk, and shell scripts and munged all the sources into one big
file, along with my own collection of definitions.	I installed an FTP
server on my desktop machine and made the dictionary available from
there, publicising it on Usenet news.</p>

<p>Around this time, Gopher was just taking off and I soon had a Gopher
server running, allowing people to search the dictionary rather than
have to download the whole thing.  Soon after that, around March 1994,
the World-Wide Web happened and I just went bonkers!  At last I could
do proper cross-referencing and use forms to get feedback as well as
adding links to other FTP, Gopher and WWW resources on the net.</p>

<p>I continued to develop the dictionary, with help from the net,
while failing to complete my PhD thesis, and later while doing a
full-time job, and helping to bring up my
sons <a href="pub/misc/mark.gif">Mark</a>
and <a href="pub/misc/alex.jpg">Alex</a>.</p>

<h2>Why?</h2>

<p>I started because I couldn't find anything similar available for FTP
(this was in the days before even Gopher, let alone WWW) and because I
wanted to play with net software.  I carry on because I enjoy
providing a service that's used by thousands of people around the
world.  It's great to get all the positive feedback and help from the
net and to find out what the hot topics in the world of computing
are.</p>

<p>I've learned a hell of a lot about computing, comms, maths and other
interesting subjects, thanks to many excellent contributions from the
knowledgeable and kind people on the net.</p>

<p>It was amazing watching the access statistics growing as more and
more people got on the Internet.  The dictionary aims to help new
Internet users cope with all the terminology, buzzwords, and acronyms
they run up against.</p>

<p>Apart from all those important reasons, it looks good on
<a href="denis-cv.html">my CV</a>.</p>

<h2>Advertising</h2>

<p>In about 2009 I was approached by an advertising agent and decided it might
be fun.  After discovering that college policy allowed advertising, I signed up.
When that deal ran out, I started showing <a
href="http://google.com/adwords">Google ads</a>.
I hope that all the good folk who've helped make FOLDOC what it is don't object.</p>

<h2>Are you a computing expert?</h2>

<p>I'm more of a jack-of-all-trades.  I'm 57 years old and have worked on or
studied many aspects of computing, including VLSI design, electronics, logic
design, processor architecture, parallel processing, natural language
processing, AI, neural networks, machine learning, assembly language, BASIC, C,
Lisp, Prolog, functional programming languages, Visual Basic, Java, Perl,
Python, JavaScript, JSP, networking, Unix kernel hacking, Windows registry
hacking, COBOL, VMS, umpteen Unixes, RISC OS, NEXTSTEP, George 9, DOS, Windows,
HTML, CSS, XML and quantum mechanics.  I've worked in industrial research and
development, academic research and corporate IT.  Having said that, I rely on
help from contributors and users for the vast majority of the knowledge
contained in FOLDOC.</p>
